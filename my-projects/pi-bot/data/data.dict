i picked up the car in feb and after 1 month of driving 
i
1

like a sport 
model

not
1

the brakes seem a bit weak but again 
they
1

bit

even though this car 
is

screen was no longer touch screen 
(as
1

bad

yes you will feel a turbo lag from a dead stop but you will be amazed how much power this little engine has it 
really
1

the mdx is a nice car that is easy to 
drive

~
i didn't think it was possible to improve 
on
1

awd suv and i would with no doubt buy it 
again
1

19/21). overall i think the build and ride is not equal to that of 
the

package such as electric tail gait 
and

i didn't think it was possible to 
improve

i have driven this car in lots of snow

the mdx is a nice car that is easy to drive although had i known i would only be 
getting
1
|
~
yes 3rd row is for kids and small 
adults
1
|
~
so no problem pulling up to upscale places! i didn't want to give 
up
1

you just need to drive it for yourself to find out if it is a fit for 
you
1

falters. i really enjoy 
driving
1

the rdx sold me 
on
1
|

blind spots are quite minimal as 
the
1
|
~
nice ride but for the bang and the buck the mdx was the clear winner!! i love the way the vehicle moves and the smooth braking action is awesome; not to mention the way it hugs the curb as i try to see what it can 
do..
1
|
~
hard. it corners better than any thing i 
have
1
|
~
main problem that i didn't notice during my test drive: if you keep the seat erect at a good angle for your posture the head rest pushes your neck down 
!!!
1
|
~
whether it's a night out on the 
town
1
|
~
i am very happy with the 
price
1

i don't think 
so
1

no defects or 
repairs
1
|
~
the mdx is much better in the snow than 3 truck base suvs i have 
owned
1

cargo space could be a little 
larger

my husband and i fell in love with the mdx in 02; bought it and when we needed a second

turbo lag is not bad; spools up faster than the 2008 cx7 
and
1
|
~
really need to read the driving 
manual
1
|
~
off the 
line
1
|
~
the mdx is a step up at every 
level
1
|
~
so far i have owned the car for a couple of months and do not 
regret
1
|
~
do get the cooler to keep 
your

like

with

in the last month my rdx has been in the shop three times and the last time 
it

but this thing 
has

of

the car actually gets quieter over the break in period and it is a vehicle 
that

we have had the new vehicle for 
a

i love all the tech gadgets i am 
a

exterior is nice in 
black
1
|
~
this is by far the best suv of 
2007
1

power is good 
enough
1

~
the road 
noise
1

power is 
just
1

good
1

what really sets the '07 apart 
for
1

~
19/21). overall i think the build and ride is not equal to that of the 
lexus
1
|
~
we have had the new vehicle for a month and we have 
not
1
|
~
however so far i am thrilled 
with
1
|
~
my 2007 mdx just two days ago and love it! it rides like a luxury suv but with the kick and sporty attitude 
of
1
|
~
i lastly checked out the new mdx and fell in love with all the features the car has and its 
new
1
|
~
cargo space is 
ample
1
|
~
i can picture driving this suv for ten years it will probably seem state of the art for the 
first
1
|
~
it's truly hard to express how great this vehicle 
is
1
|
~
w/3rd row seats (x5 q7 gx 
470)
1

it with a bmw x5 
(07-

a great car for those that need the third row but 
love

i've strictly driven lexus for the past few years due to the quality 
and
1
|
~
a great car for those that need the third row 
but
1
|
~
turns out this car is a lot of fun to drive and feels solid 
all
1
|
~
previous review said they 
had
1
|
~
a great car for those that need the third 
row
1
|
~
interior fit and finish looks to be gm level the exterior fit of various bits is not up to current 
detroit
1
|
~
to find out that the car lacked some features i thought would be standard across 
all
1
|
~
a great car for those 
that
1
|
~
smoother to drive except the steering is so heavy it feels as if your 
are
1
|
~
sound system beats my stereo at home! my children 
love
1
|
~
the mdx is a nice car that is easy to drive although had i known i would 
only
1
|
~
yes the ride is stiff but it's nearly as much fun to drive as my wife's mini cooper which is 
saying
1

i test drove several suvs (audi q7 rx 350 bmw x5 buick 
enclave

blast

good luck sorry you have 
this
1
|
~
system i 
love
1

this may be because the engine needs to 
break
1
|
~
much more nimbler than the mercedes ml class.) the ride is 
pretty

purchase and both 
my
1

best nav i have 
seen
1

i wouldn't trade it 
for

bottom line 
-
1
|
~
i have set it at 80 mph and climbed a 
12%-18%
1
|
~
they just pop out and you think "there's onother feature i did't 
know!!"
1
|
~
watch out for the awd status display on the dash; you should 
have
1
|
~
and the rear view camera has been 
useless
1
|
~
i wouldn't trade 
it
1

i loved the awd of my audi 
but
1

powerful engine 
feels

also am hearing a series of thud sounds when shifting

yes the car can handle but at a price of crappy ride quality the comfort

people

when cruising at 80 it feels like you're doing 50 because it is so quiet and

it is one of the best vehicles i have ever

i have enjoyed it 
from

1

what really sets the '07 apart for us is the handling on 
the
1

base 
model
1

my 4-runner gets about 20 to 22 mpg 
and
1

and does 
not

all types of suvs i narrowed it down to the 
rdx

the

i had an '04 mdx and i 
like

was

i use it for business as a home care doctor but

do not drive off-road and was 
amazed

it's amazing how much hp a 4 cylinder with a turbo can give you and not to mention the decent

deals with the cargo space

really breaks

i bought the car on the

i'm thrilled i have the mdx! thank you acura you have a fan who

to it as well! 
very

thought i was going to buy an

go get 
it

mileage is fair but you must 
use

as a single male in his 30s i am the demo they were going for

this is the best of

you don't have to think twice before buying mdx because it's 
got

we liked the 
car

cost as 
it

you don't have to think twice before buying mdx because

i have to put the gear in

color bumper is tacky imo for

1

you don't have to think twice before buying 
mdx
1

~
once i saw 
this
1
|
~
and the awd delivers amazing handling in all 
kinds
1
|
~
the rdx handles way better 
than
1

~
but no suv out there drives this 
well
1

~
it gets 22 
to
1

i've strictly driven lexus 
for
1

you don't have to think twice before

that needs to be updated because sprint big

i test drove several suvs (audi q7 rx 350 bmw x5 buick enclave chevy tahoe looked at the lr3 gmc acadia) and nothing came close to the drive and luxury 
that
1

i have a two and a half year old and we added a side rail 
(step)
1

is in the 
past

the mdx matches 
the

i just went through

you don't have

it was a worth wait to get mdx sh-awd acura advance which has

of

the front seat feels crowded and i have to crouch down in

would like to have seen the vehicle have a built in phone holder 
and
1
|
~
handling (sh-awd and ads) very safe feeling

1

it was a worth wait 
to
1

also the car has too much wind noise and the

features are easy to use and the 
voice
1

mileage is ok been getting an overall average of 19 mpg 
this
1

it was a 
worth
1
|
~
this car puts a smile on my 
face
1
|
~
my only complain is that the 
voice
1
|
~
etc. we are coming from a bmw 
528i
1
|
~
so far i have owned the car for a couple of months and do not regret 
the

work great too giving a wide area 
of

while we enjoy driving this people's heads start turning 
on
1
|
~
and the heated seats work 
very
1
|

i was looking at the bmw but in the end i thought the rdx was simply a better 
ride
1
|
~
we traded my wife's 02 rx 300 
that
1
|
~
love this car!! i have had no problem 
in
1
|
~
i feel as if this vehicle is a 
bargin
1
|
~
to you that is broken then just "fixing 
it"
1
|
~
i use on line reviews a lot but don't often have time to give 
back
1
|
~
this was designed to compete with bmw's 
x3
1
|
~
but for the 
young
1
|
~
no interior space or trunk space in spite of 
being
1
|
~
1400 miles over 3 days and it worked better than my 03 
mdx
1
|
~
this suv offers a 
lot
1

~
i owned porsche and bmw quality can not compare - great value 
and
1

~
2007 mdx and 
what
1

~
i got the tech package being 
a
1
|

also am hearing a series of thud sounds when shifting 1st to 2nd with little to no 
load
1
|
~
of going back to a 4 cylinder engine (even though i had owned many 4 cylinder cars in the past) since many newer small suvs 
have
1
|
~
while we enjoy 
driving
1
|
~
i found the turbo to 
be
1

suvs in its class but mdx 
has

not only is the rdx just the right size it's actually more fun to 
drive!!

and handles as well as the 
bmw

it performs 
like

great power once 
you
1

and the engine 
is
1

~
not as smooth as my lexus but plenty 
of
1

~
nothing 
else
1
|
but
1
|
and
1
|
~
in order to get 12-14 mpg a person must be mashing to pedal 
and
1
|
~
the fit and finish on this vehicle is some of the 
bese
1
|
~
bought an 
aberdeen
1
|
~
kept it for a couple years and traded it on a nissan 
titan
1

i would have to sum up to say that this vehicle is a very 
big

i'm very happy and have had many vehicles before due to leases for work but 
i

we were previous owners of an rx8 and making

my son got on the roof to make sure that the bikes were placed in the rack properly ? just like we?ve done on other cars we?ve owned 
with
1

i got the black cherry pearl sport 
fully
1

main problem that i didn't notice during my test drive: if you keep the seat erect at a good angle for your posture the head rest 
pushes
1

the mdx feels 
planted

just got it the other day and i am very happy with the

on steep hill climbs 
like

it handles like it wants to be a sports sedan but it has the luxury and utility to make it one of the 
best

the looks i get 
etc

this suv has much less pick up than my 01 v8 grand cherokee which it replaced (i leave on 'hills' and the car can't stay 60mph on 5th and takes a long time to shift to

for an suv (about 21 mpg) and the fun factor is a 10! the ride 
is

acura claims that it is a safety feature but it only works

the dealer has not been able to fix the problem and acura said they have company cars the act the

i had done my research against lexus audi toyota

i bought acura because we have had great cars from honda but this isn't built nearly as well as my wife's

i'ved owned a couple bmws and we just bought for 
my
1

and the rear view camera has been useless 
to

i took a chance 
and
1

me and my

1

very good power 
once
1
|
~
and the gps system but the car rides awesome nice pick-up and everyone just loves the look of the 
car
1
|
~
even if i was willing to pay more for a car i would still end up with the rdx that's 
how
1

takes 
some

curves

this may be because the engine needs to break in but with my last acura (mdx) getting poor gas milage

we were in the market for a suv with a third row that doesn't feel heavy to drive and we 
have

wind

take

and her decision 
was
1

the '07 picks up where the '02 left off - more power more comfort

fuel economy isnt all that great in the city but on the highway its very 
good

good cargo area - the rdx fit the bill for

please keep in mind that

love my rdx - a suped-up honda with awd! all the bells and whistles 
of

this is my first acura and it sure is 
a

my mdx elite 
in
1

and the car is full 
of
1

~
bolt that 
made

system that they did not even bother using the game system which we can plug in 
the
1

that car saved

a smart looking car however 
not

bolt 
that

i loved all of them! this is very similar to x5 only leaves 
$20,000

entry is awkward seat and steering wheel take position when i get in the car rather than waiting until door 
is

i've had my mdx for about a month now;

it rides like (even better than) my lexus es 330 and it still does the job for skiing surfing and road trips!! 
this
1
|
~
we just returned from 
a
1
|
~
equipped x5 was $14k higher - no 
budging
1

best suv 
for
1

so
1
|
~
bought the sport with ent package 
in
1
|

nothing but 
problems
1
|

i thought the ride was a bit fairer on the bmw but i felt the handling and 
power
1
|
~
i have really good image of honda also 
i
1
|
~
i ordered the rdx in may and received it in 
sep
1
|

love the hard rear deck 
when
1

if i had known that the mileage would be this 
bad
1
|
~
i have had my 07 mdx for about 2 months now i love the thing 
from

we had a maxima gle but this has way more zip and is great

i have had my 07 mdx for about 2 months now i love 
the

"live" traffic 
update

safe vehicle great for our 
growing
1
|
~
this may be because the engine needs 
to
1
|
~
while i don't think 
this
1
|
~
when compared with these other luxury suvs i would have had to pay around $60k to get the same 
amount
1
|
~
the blind spots are a problem but once you know you are just 
extra
1
|
~
to drive down the switch backs and snowy icey 
hills
1
|
~
i have owned over 
the
1
|

both from the remote lock / unlock and 
the
1

interior looked too yellow put with upgrade to sport the leather 
looks
1
|

interior fit and finish 
looks
1
|
~
and drove all kinds of 
cars
1
|
~
the ride is a bit bouncy at times but handling 
is
1
|
~
is higher than i expected 
but
1
|
~
only thing that i'd really like to see are flat 2nd row seats for 
better
1
|
~
i have had my 07 mdx for about 2 
months

is amazing and easy to get used to (my wife is not a tech geek at all and she is loving the nav blue

the

i have a two and a half year old and we added a side rail (step) and glad we did little guy can get in easier by himself 
and

the engine is smooth the white lights are super bright the sound system is amazing and it does not feel like a big car behind 
the

i test drove several suvs (audi q7 rx 350 bmw x5 buick enclave chevy tahoe looked at the lr3 gmc acadia) and nothing came 
close

i bought the tech 
package
1

i love xm and 
if

great 18" michelin tires and 
the

bolt that made 
noise

quiet refined full of gadgets

there is room for my wife's luggage 
the

i hope resale is 
as
1

i tried other small suvs in this 
range

- it feels a little like the shocks but it 
isn't

i test drove audi g7 lexus

i'm a realtor in colorado and went up

so the acura was the 
answer
1

between sept 2007 and april 2008 i 
had

i just traded in my 2002 
mdx

several

we always take this on trips and it 
is

i have a two and a half year old and 
we
1

(i test drove mazda cx7 bmw x3 ford fusion gmc arcadia) totally pale 
in
1

usable room 
and
1

gas mileage on last trip was over 24 mpg seems 
to
1

the gas to keep up with 
traffic
1

when i first drove the new '07 
model
1

i didn't buy it as 
a

so much fun to drive it makes

thanks for making a suv that won't make me look like a soccer mom! what

my use of the car is limited to a 10 round trip commute to the office 5 
days
1
|
~
kept it for a couple years and 
traded
1
|
~
are gas mileage and bumpy ride but those are very easy 
to
1
|
~
handling (sh-awd and ads) very safe 
feeling
1
|
~
kids also love being able to bring the game cube or ps2 and i 
just
1
|
~
i have owned two hondas in the past (civic and accord) and wanted another honda but wanted more luxury than the 
pilot
1
|
~
yikes!!! the mdx sport handles better than top of the line porsche 
of
1
|
~
and will probably 
just
1
|
~
the center console 
will
1

is
1

sound system very nice navi is the easist i've seen although the voice commands are a little rough so far for 
me

while not the briskest off the line from 4000 rpm and above this beast will 
compare
1

someone 
talked

system i love the els stereo though i 
still

heavy tech features without the heavy price! did a

also

while not

the

i chose mdx with tech 
package
1

after a couple of months of trying to convince my wife to trade our 2004 lexus gx 470 i finally wore her down 
and
1
|

but gas mileage was terrible and we had to replace the front brakes and rotors every 
5000

this suv offers a lot in standard features

this suv has much less pick up than my 01 v8 grand cherokee which it replaced (i leave on 'hills' and the car can't stay 60mph on 5th and takes a long time to shift to 4th which is way too high rpm) - but slightly better gas mileage for a larger car

it's a blast 
to

come on!!! a chevy 
has
1

~
shame on 
you
1
|
~
i've had my mdx for about 4 months now and it's a fabulous vehicle all the way 
around
1
|
~
so no problem pulling up to upscale places! i didn't want to give up space to pop things in the back and go so i keep 
the
1

~
i have had the rdx for two months and think it is a 
blast

after the door was 
fixed

else 
more

about

is

beside this being my 3rd honda product (2000 accord coupe and then 2005 acura tsx) 
i
1
|
~
i have owned two hondas in the 
past
1
|
~
i hate the steering wheel! it's not the wheel that's 
so
1
|
~
i can get about 25mpg highway 
with
1
|
~
you have a luxury car for a great 
price
1
|
~
i have owned two hondas 
in
1
|

build quality and design is superb and the options you 
get
1
|

so far and i love the luxury feel of the inside with an awesome sport feel that i would not be able to get from 
the
1
|
~
i drove a bmw prior to this and loved it but i am thrilled with my acura 
rl
1
|
~
the '07 picks up where the '02 left off - more power more comfort and 
improved
1
|
~
it is such a 
great
1
|
~
on it and i would purchase 
this
1
|
~
with almost anything not in 
the
1
|
~
with acura for the 
last
1
|
~
the nav 
is
1
|
system
3
|
and
1
|
~
do wish that the roof rails side running boards and side body moldings did not have to be extras but they make the car look 
so
1
|
~
before buying i really suggest taking the local roads rather than just hopping onto the closest freeway with no 
radio
1
|
~
i am the kind of guy that 
will
1
|
~
if not the best vehicle for under $40k it has to be in the 
top
1
|
~
i love the interior 
design
1
|
~
- much better than the old 
model
1
|
~
my mdx elite in 
sport
1
|

one test drive will sell 
this
1

the 07 mdx is 
in
1

my land cruiser was too big my fx45 was 
a
1
|
~
there is a good amount of turbo lag making it feel sluggish from a start 
and
1
|
~
the brakes seem 
a
1
|
~
wow!! no vehicle is safe but i feel a sense of security in 
my
1

in the city 
i
1
|
~
this car has plenty 
of
1
|
~
is great it corners well 
and
1
|
~
with it is minimal but all for now i can observe and suggest that acura 
improve
1
|
~
only thing that i'd really like to see are flat 2nd 
row
1
|
~
the exterior styling is a real head turner much better 
than
1
|
~
car to drive 
and
1
|
~
i drove the x5 bmw and the mercedes ml class and 
neither
1
|
~
gas mileage on last trip was over 24 mpg seems to improve with each 
trip
1

just bought the rdx a few weeks ago and i love it!! this is my first suv i test drove others but when i 
drove
1
|
~
i love my new mdx it 
drives
1
|
~
love it & would buy 
it
1
|
~
this car so she could have a safe reliable vehicle that could also be great for kids 
and
1
|
~
also the gps 
is
1
|
~
stereo is best short of audi a8 which runs 
$8,000
1
|
~
about the ride i have had 
cars
1
|
~
annual gas costs will be about $2500 per year 
which
1
|
~
we have put close 
to
1
|
~
while the 
overall
1
|
adults
1
|
~
i also like the fact that i don't see 
these
1
|
~
the interior design is a little star trek for me but once 
i
1
|
~
is amazing and easy to 
get
1
|
~
- we traveled with a baby 
&
1
|

smoother to drive except the steering is so heavy it feels as if your are driving 
a

and other 
tech

minor
1

2007 mdx may 
be

and
1

not only is the rdx just the 
right

rear camera takes 10 sec when backing up (making it much less 
useful)

i'm amazed at how well the mdx holds it's

much more nimbler than the mercedes ml class.) the ride is pretty good but not in the

just a great car and an even better

only thing that i'd really like to see are flat 2nd row seats for better cargo

i must confess this is probably the best vehicle honda has ever made right up there with such ground breakers as

i feel as if this vehicle is a bargin even at msrp! acura simply

1

i knew this was the car for me the first time i 
test
1
|
~
system and i can still 
listen
1
|
~
this is by far the best suv i have 
owned
1
|
~
in an suv should put this on their list! once they 
drive
1
|
~
and rear 
camera
1
|
~
- handling on par with best sport sedans very quiet rides better than most 
luxury
1
|
~
i never thought of being so happy of a honda 
over
1
|
~
on a luxury $40,000 dollar car they would install a 
plastic
2
|
~
being in 
the
1

is like driving a pogo stick and the sport setting is ok as long as the road is 
smooth
1
|
~
although for some reason it 
keeps
1
|
~
it took about a month to 
adjust
1
|
~
with highway 
driving
1
|
~
its a new design so only time will tell what the recalls will be 
if
1
|
~
cargo space could be a little larger but larger space = larger body = more weight = fewer 
mpg
1

the rl is a solid vehicle and is equipped with just 
about

i can picture driving this suv for ten years it will probably seem state of the art for the first 
five
1

handles like a bmw but with more "toys"

i'm

after months of careful research and test drives 
at

17.5 after 600 miles of 
mixed
1

~
i had been looking for a tall (better line of 
sight)
1
|
~
in the 8 months i have owned it acura 
had
1
|
~
wow is all i can 
say
1
|
~
on it and i would purchase this car again if i had to do it again! i used to drive a 
mercedes
1
|
~
this is my second mdx 
after
1
|
-
1
|
~
safe for the family and it has awd - for a price of under 35k 
you
1
|
~
of going back to a 4 cylinder engine (even though i had owned many 4 cylinder cars in the past) since many newer small suvs have 6s 
in
1
|
~
the audio 
system
2
|
~
the ride is so smooth and the power is 
there
1
|
~
of pull through curves precise handling and a smooth ride with the benefit of the 
sport
1
|
~
interior fit and finish looks to be gm level the exterior fit of various 
bits
1
|
~
set up i have 
in
1
|
~
i narrowed my choices to the mdx q7 and xc90 and the mdx won without 
too
1
|
~
i had a little bit of an initial quality 
problem
1
|
~
easy to drive 
around
1
|
~
the prelim reviews 
were
1
|
~
it's the most unique vehicle on 
the
1
|
~
i loved all of them! this is very similar to 
x5
1
|
~
last suv's were yukon xl and 
envoy
1
|
~
for the ne the ride is real 
hard
1
|
~
i love all the tech gadgets i 
am
1
|
~
handles like a bmw but with more "toys" and 
better
1
|
~
i would have to sum up to say that this vehicle is 
a
1
|
~
my mdx 
elite
1
|
~
drive it like a 6 cyl and you'll too complain about the 
gas
1
|
~
the mdx is a nice car that is easy to drive although had i known i would only be getting 12.5 mpg around 
town
1
|
~
suv. they work great when heading out with a 
few
1
|
~
the numbers the 
mdx
1
|
~
back seats 
are
1
|
~
needs a 
lot
1
|
~
makes knocking noises when both speed and rpm are low as 
if
1
|
~
we made the right 
choice
1
|
~
we just 
passed
1
|
returned
1
|
~
so it's not a bad 
balance
1
|
~
smoother to drive except the steering is so heavy it feels as if your are driving a truck 
3
1
|
~
turbo lag is not bad; spools up faster than the 2008 
cx7
1
|
~
this one seems quieter 
than
1
|
~
i have had my 
rdx
2
|
mdx
1
|
07
1
|
~
and curves and a 
solid
1
|
~
lr3 and the 
acura
1
|
~
i don't want to go to work in the morning i want to keep going! 
this
1
|
~
you feel the road unlike any other 
suv
1
|
~
before deciding on my purchase of the rdx 
with
1
|
~
last 
week
1
|
suv's
1
|
~
is mild 
for
1
|
~
navi 
and
1
|
~
i have owned two hondas in 
the
1
|
~
there is room for my 
wife's
1
|
~
but i believe the car will live up to its price several times over as 
many
1
|
~
the mdx is a very smooth ride easy to 
handle
1
|
~
for the same items and options in others would have 
cost
1
|
~
vehicles in the past 
and
1
|
~
you can't 
beat
1
|
go
1
|
~
this is my second 
mdx
2
|
~
like the styling and comfort 
but
1
|
~
a lot and find it 
very
1
|
~
and i would be very suprised if it doesn't win a 
lot
1
|
~
in the last month my rdx has been in the shop three times and the last time it didn't even last a week before the emission light went on again and when it goes on it seem to shift 
down
1
|
~
i'm thrilled i have the mdx! thank you 
acura
1
|
~
from what used to be smooth 
revving
1
|
~
this is the first japanese suv we have 
had
1
|
~
nothing and i mean nothing compares with this vehicle for the price 
paid
1
|
~
2007 mdx and what 
a
1
|
~
and the ride is 
one
1
|
~
never had an suv with the 
power
1
|
~
between the two was 
obvious
1
|
~
i just traded 
my
1
|
in
1
|
~
steering wheel every time i waited in front of the red 
light
1
|
~
steering wheel could go another inch i'm 6'1" just 
to
1
|
~
etc. we are coming 
from
1
|
~
this is the first japanese suv we 
have
1
|
~
ride and lot's of bells and whistles for the 
price
1
|
~
about this vehicle is top tier fit and 
finish
1
|
~
it's very quiet with a nice engine 
growl
1
|
~
with a lot 
of
1
|
~
finding awd for 
under

i drove the x5 bmw and the mercedes ml class and neither car can hold a candle to my '07 mdx.this vehicle is as solid as a rock yet moves like a 
light
1

i owned 
porsche
1

hondas
1

and
1

this car (it's not really an suv) really goes! 
the

we got 11mpg on the first tank 13mpg on the second tank and have 
not
1

highway miles per gallon 22-23 mpg @74mph city 17-18 mpg the only 
problem

the mdx is much better in the snow than

our first child in a few

as

- but fuel economy is a 
big
1

it's exactly the same as my

the only thing i would change would be the shape

hard in corners and feeling this suv handle

wouldn't want to give up any of the fine 
handling

here was my must have list and what the

how crips it handles for

on it and i would purchase this car again if i had

lets 
go

and i would be very suprised 
if
1

in my 
opinion

i bought this car to replace a

i would have 
liked

to

i have a two and a half year old and we added a side rail (step)

i have owned my mdx for about 1 1/2 yrs & have loved every minute of driving the 24k problem free miles on it! it is so much fun to drive; looks &

i have always bought acuras but this is one is a

easily

this car so she could

i owned and still

i love all 
the

i wouldn't trade it for

driving and love every minute of driving it! it's more like a sport sedan 
than
1

about this car except that i have been 
into
1
|
~
the tech gadgets function well 
but
1
|
~
no turbo lag; hit the gas and off you 
go
1

~
it handles like it wants to be a sports sedan 
but
1

car drives nicely although the sportier ride can be a bit too 
harsh

for my

the engine is smooth the white lights are super bright 
the

sound system beats my stereo at home! my children love

we just passed the 5,000 mile mark and the mdx is still the best suv 
on
1

the straight 
line
1

feature is by far 
the
1
|
~
i just went through a b1 service oil change 
and
1
|
~
build quality and design is superb and the 
options
1
|
~
and the worst 6) the steering is so hard my wrists hurt when trying to turn a 
corner
1
|
~
the leather seems to be better 
quality
1
|
~
as a father who runs many errands with my son i am pleased with the size of the rdx as it has 
plenty
1
|
~
as one who had been driving 6 & 8 cyl cars i was leery of the 4cyl 
turbo
1
|
~
while not in the suv class of my 
old
1
|
~
factor. i have owned 3 
vw
1
|
~
with 3rd seat folded and back 
seats
1
|

i test drove the bmw x3 x5 owned the honda 
pilot
1
|
~
front & back seats are quite roomy & backseat easily folds down flat 
(2/3
1
|
~
i loved all of them! this is very similar to x5 
only
1
|
~
back cargo area is very roomy 
and
1
|
~
is that of a much larger car then the old one but when i get out and look at it it looks much smaller then the replaced 
mdx
1

suv

our first child in 
a

is nice & 
stiff
1

~
back cargo area is very 
roomy
1
|
~
plenty of power and awd when skiing plenty of room for baggage great mpg for an suv navi system is far superior to 
gm's
1
|
~
the engine is very 
peppy
1
|
noisy
1

~
and more at 12-14k less than that european 
"thing"
1

~
my previous cars were 
no
1

we had their temp set to 78 as they are always cold and i was feeling good 
around
1

we need 
the
1
|
~
less than its 
teutonic
1
|
~
the ride is so smooth and the power is there when you 
need
1
|
~
this car is luxury drives like a 
sports
1
|
~
we got the rare 
color
1
|
~
this suv has much less pick up than my 01 v8 grand cherokee which it replaced (i leave on 'hills' and the car can't stay 60mph on 5th and takes a long time to shift to 4th which is way too high rpm) - but slightly better gas mileage 
for
1
|
~
ride comfort 
great
1
|
~
so no problem pulling up to upscale places! i didn't want to give up space to pop things in 
the
1
|
~
my wife wanted her latest vehicle to be 
an
1
|
~
i bought acura because we have had great cars from honda 
but
1
|
~
the engine has plenty of pep the interior has plenty of luxury and 
the
1
|
~
quick corners nicely fuel economy could be 
better
1
|
~
rear camera takes 10 sec when backing up (making it much 
less
1
|
~
out 
it
1
|
~
we always take this 
on
1
|
~
i lastly checked out the new mdx and fell in love with all the 
features
1
|
~
even if i was willing to pay more for 
a
1
|
~
the mdx with just about every luxury suv (ie x5 
xc90)
1
|
~
was kinda 
shocked
1
|
~
back cargo area is 
very
1
|
~
the rear view mirror appears to block 1/3 
of
1
|
~
system although it does 
need

choice
1
|
~
driving. drove up to tahoe in snow and the 
awd
1
|
~
also missing 
some
1
|
~
so no problem pulling up to upscale places! i didn't want to give up 
space
1
|
~
it took about a month to adjust to a bumpier ride but the handling is very similar to a car and not 
a
1
|
~
for the same items 
and
1
|
~
work and family driving less painful and that is exactly what i was looking 
for
1
|
~
we just passed the 5,000 mile mark and the mdx is still the best suv on the market today 
imho
1
|
~
the only thing i would change would be 
the
1
|
~
priced 
better
1
|
~

there is some turbo lag but once the turbo winds up you're pressed to the back of your 
seat
1

i can't believe i am saying 
this
1

i lastly checked out the new mdx and fell in love with all the features the car has 
and

i chose this suv for a couple specific reasons: i needed a 
vehicle

some might say that it drives too harsh; however i am more than willing 
to
1

but we saw the rdx - 
good

kept it for a couple years and traded it on a

this is our 3rd acura & is the best and our favorite one to date! this car is simply awesome! the awd in the

this may be because the engine needs to break

gas and

and simple to 
use
1

i have the tech 
package

that will improve once the engine

about trading my 05 for it but 
i'm

we just returned from a week driving through the alps and this suv 
is
1
|
~
has good display and gives clear 
and
1

i decided to trade in my tl for this 
because
1
|
~
got this vehicle because of the value that was 
packed
1
|
~
to sum it up if gas 
mileage
1
|

so far and i love the luxury feel of the inside with an awesome sport feel that 
i
1

the tech package is cool 
if
1

added roof rack -

love my rdx - a 
suped-up
1

it rides like (even better than) my lexus es 330 and it still does the job for skiing surfing and road trips!! this car fits 6 adults 
in
1
|
~
and the heated seats work very 
well
1
|
~
i would have to sum up 
to
1

i have a two and a half year old and we added a side rail (step) and glad we 
did

that the rdx did not give

honda has simply built an suv version of the

with it is minimal but all for now i can observe and suggest that acura improve the ride 
with

drop 
and
1

we need the awd for the snow and the

my wife and i both drive the vehicle so the custom seat mirror radio and phone

yes you will feel a turbo lag from a dead stop but you will be amazed how much power this little engine has it really 
moves

i read how good it was but you cannot believe 
it

i got the sport just because of 
the

on

so the acura

the ride is so smooth and the power is there when 
you

the new mdx is just about 
as

too bad i have just one so my wife drives it and

price. this is my second acura and it is every

before buying i really suggest taking the local roads rather than just hopping onto 
the

miles a year for 
work

as it could possibly be and has every possible bell

i must confess this 
is

the third row cannot

the sh-awd system coupled with the manual shift mode

you simply can

i am so happy with that i let

i have owned my

the interior design is a little star trek for me but once i 
figured
1

so far i have owned the car for a couple 
of
1
|
~
owner of all the quality and comfort acura has 
to
1
|
~
this vehicle about one week ago and 
couldn't
1
|
~
if you can find one buy it loaded! taupe 
interior
1
|
~
granted i get to drive it much faster than i could in the states but 
even
1

cost as it requires premium and special oil 4 times the cost 
of

after months of 
careful
1

i have plenty of room while 
at

the

the motor is rough for a luxury car

i have had my mdx over 
a

dueler tires with b/b rating i would expect best quality 
for

turning

finally

bought the sport with ent package in feb and have already taken 2 trips over 300

may be better in one category or another but overall none

it's a blast to drive

and the gps system but the car rides awesome nice pick-up and everyone just 
loves

i am the kind of guy that will research vehicles for months and months before 
making
1

the dealer has not been able to fix the 
problem
1

i just moved to germany two months ago and bought an 07 mdx from another military 
member
1

i ordered the rdx in may and received it in sep 06 and it was 
worth
1

front seats handles very 
well
1

performs almost as well as our mercedes e class but has the 
utility
1

the ride is so smooth 
and
1

i never was fan of suvs but i really 
love
1

this turned out to be a giant mistake even though acura never 
states
1

i've only had it for a very short while 
but
1

work and family 
driving
1

but so far with 2000 miles on it 
its

we have put close to 3000 miles in

yes it had a luxury ride and feel but wasn't 
quite

package

poor gas mileage and limited

unsold

out it is 
a

i have taken the mdx

after a couple

stereo is best i've ever heard 
in

to you that 
is

sadly 
it's

the rear seats do fold down for a very

overall it's the best

i only have 1k miles on the clock so it's still 
too
1

kept it for a couple years and traded it

drove down to

i drove the x5 bmw and the mercedes ml class and neither car can hold a candle to my '07 mdx.this vehicle is as solid as a rock yet moves like a light 
jet
1
|
~
by far this 2007 mdx out performs all the 
above
1
|
~
we decided to look into the luxury suv segment and 
narrowed
1
|
~
with it is minimal but all for now i can observe and suggest that acura improve 
the
1
|
~
acuras are rare in 
germany
1

i'd like 
to
1
|
~
after a couple of months of trying to convince my wife to trade our 2004 lexus gx 470 i finally wore 
her
1
|
~
get one and have 
fun
1
|
~
overall the suv 
is
1
|
~
best vehicle we have ever 
owned!!
1
|
~
resisted at first but since it was the vehicle that my wife would 
be
1
|
~
this vehicle should have made with a 6 spd 
manual
1
|
~
bottom line - 
best
1
|
~
:d! i 
love
1
|
~
i settled on the mdx without 
a
1
|
~
it turns out that the rdx has a much nicer interior 
and
1
|
~
lets go buy 
the
1
|
~
in the last month my rdx has been in the shop three times and the last time it didn't even last a week before the emission light went on again and when it goes on it seem to shift down and have less power it has been in the shop this time for a week and they don't know what's wrong with it they are in contact with japan now and still have no 
idea
1
|
~
granted i get to drive it much faster than i could in the states but even at 120 mph it was 
rock
1
|
~
is just beyond reproach for a vehicle with this size 
and
1
|
~
i picked up the car in feb and after 
1
1
|
~
i hope resale is as good on this as it was on my 
tl
1
|
~
best of all the mdx moves! the mdx has 
more
1
|
~
i didn't have to test drive any other after i test drove the 
mdx
1
|
~
notice how i said "car" - it does not drive like a 
suv
1
|
~
i just traded in my 2002 mdx for the new 2007 mdx and am about to trade again! the new car 
is
1
|
~
interior fit and 
finish
1
|
~
i never dreamed that this 
car
1
|
~
mdx won out over the lexus and cost less for a very well 
equipped
1
|
~
mirror which is now finally included and the open bottom of the steering wheel 
to
1
|
~
the most bang for the buck in every aspects compared to other 
vehicles
1
|
~
build quality and design is superb 
and
1
|
~
took the car from the dealer then drove 2000 miles over the past 
3
1

~
drive one hear one and make one go 
around
1

its a new 
design

lots of techno gizmos to keep

1

~
a lexus rx 300 and a 330 and having test driven the 2007 lexus gx 470 and the bmw x5 i can 
say
1
|
~
i settled on the mdx without a doubt in 
mind
1
|
~
a unique 
design
1
|
~
the sound that 
comes
1

we are very pleased 
with

i never thought of being so happy of a honda over 
the

i decided to trade in my tl for this because i wanted 
all
1

the ride is a 
bit
1

~
took the car from the dealer then drove 2000 miles over the 
past
1

and have not found many flaws with this vehicle at 
all
1
|
~
the epa is 19/23 but thus far we have had no

after driving a suburban for 6 years 
i'm
1

the only problems is that with this 2007 the bumper front 
and
2
|
~
wheel is 
asinine
1

wow!! no vehicle is safe but i 
feel
1
|
~
but so much 
that
1

~
i'm a realtor in colorado and went up to whale rock road in bellvue 
to
1

it's truly hard to express how 
great
1

ability and better brakes 
this
1

may be better in one category or another but overall none is 
even
1

i drove a bmw prior to this and loved 
it
1

i'm amazed at how well the mdx holds it's own with the little sports car as far 
as
1
|

braking are superb and rival my 
wife's
1

i just traded my beloved infiniti fx for this 
mdx

the auto 
window
1

the tech gadgets function well but you have to take 20 hours to 
read
1

then there is 
a

~
i chose the rdx because i wanted sport sedan like handling 
and
1
|

market. the stereo system is the 
best
1
|
~
i don't need to use it a 
lot
1
|
~
i also test drove 
the
1
|
~
while we enjoy driving this people's heads 
start
1
|
~
larger engine gives it a little more power but the interior fit and 
finish
1
|
~
tag to 
high
1
|
~
and will 
probably
1
|
~
is that of a much larger car then the 
old

i feel as if this vehicle is a bargin even at 
msrp!

if you are in the market for

plenty of power and awd when skiing plenty of room for

love my rdx - a suped-up honda with awd! all the bells and whistles of 
a

that is why i decided 
to
1

~
ok if you have not driven an rdx go do 
it
1
|
~
improved overall from 
an
1
|
~
we have an accord and 
honda
1
|
~
the truck based suv choices didn't have ride 
&
1
|
~
also the back seats do not fold down so there is no way in which you can expand the cargo space 
(why
1
|
~
honda corp only tell me they can try and "have it fixed" it's been in 7 
times
1
|
~
and has a 
great
1
|
~
an suv that out performs many sports sedans and 
handles
1

i think it is geared more towards gas mileage until you get on it and then 
it
1

coming from 
a
1

glad i spent 
the
1

~
i drove the 
acura

x5
1
|

the 2001 mdx touring 
when
1

get the sport package - handling 
is

i ordered the rdx in may and received it in sep 06 and it was worth the wait 
mostly

we did the head to head test drives 
with

we love the voice controls for 
nav
1

matter of fact it is 
tough
1

~
acuras are rare in germany and i get stares all the time 
by
1

it. most features were 
easy
1

~
we got rid of our 
audi
1

big honda 
fan
1

small enough to get around the beltway nasty traffic yet big enough to 
allow

i bought a tl after i had a pilot needless to say i 
missed

|
~
this car may be good on a track 
for
1

i narrowed my choices to the mdx q7 and xc90 and the 
mdx
1
|
~
i've owned acura sedans before the last being a 
2004
1
|
~
if you have a family with a 
bunch
1
|
~
a unique design 
inside
1
|
~
nice ride but for the bang and the buck the mdx was the clear winner!! i love the way the vehicle moves and the smooth braking action is awesome; not to mention the 
way
1
|
~
i chose mdx with tech package didn't go 
for
1
|
~
while not the briskest off the line from 4000 rpm 
and
1

is awesome 
and

with

linked
1

the 10 way power driver's seat combined 
with
1

the mdx with just 
about

seat started to 
rattle
1

this is my first and last 
acura

~
sound system very nice navi is the easist i've seen although 
the
1

well. still all in all 
it's
1

and the gps system but 
the
1

around 
every

the brakes seem a bit weak but again they may need 
to

for an suv i love the way 
this
1

a 265hp v8 a test 
drive
1

a light suv you should consider and 
put

is even better with a k&n

the kids love the dvd 
so

drive of any vehicle i have 
owned

dealer says to wait until 2000 miles before bringing it in but we have 1300 miles on it coming 
back

really enjoyed the xm radio and the sound

1

when compared with these other luxury suvs i would have had to pay around $60k to get the

got this vehicle because of the value that was packed into 
this

i think it is geared more towards gas mileage until

you can program

we fell in love with this new suv

wow. i do have to say that acura 
has
1

averaged around 20-21 mpg on our 
trip
1
|
~
i upgraded from an original 2001 mdx 
to

this is by 
far

but anyone with ears! it's better than the 
several

the more you drive it the more you 
like

i have owned my mdx for about 1 1/2 yrs & have loved every minute of driving the 24k problem free miles on it! it is so much fun to drive; looks

can do anything from find a location

the only thing i really hate is having to fill up the tank

in the rear view mirror low quality for the type

it's easy to park around the city the back up

the build quality is very good with a few 
minor

after months of careful research and test drives at bmw 
lexus
1

the mdx is a nice car that is easy to drive although had i known i would only be getting 12.5 mpg around town i probably would 
have
1

~
i have taken it on a few long trips and am also very happy 
with
1

to 70 mph to merge with 
55mph
1

mpg for one 
year
1

~
(and prior vehicle was 99 
passat)
1
|
~
you only need to feather the gas pedal and the turbo will 
move
1
|
~
first thing i want to say is that this suv handles better than a vehicle this large 
and
1
|
~
front seats 
handles

nav at some 
point

the front seating

one no memory seats what's up with that this

owner of all the quality and comfort acura has to offer 
(which
1

nice ride but for 
the
1

being a female i find most of the suvs are too big 
and
1

when i first drove the new '07 model it seemed too big 
and

granted i get to drive it much faster than i could in the 
states
1

is higher than

this car is really fun

the shift paddles are right

this may be because the engine needs to break in but with my last acura (mdx) getting poor gas milage i am 
starting

my wife and i both drive the vehicle 
so

traded in my 2001 lexus rx

just got it the other day and i am very happy 
with

we had their temp set to 78 as they are always cold and i was feeling good around 
72

is just beyond reproach 
for

and food cold so you don't have to stop and buy food (helps offset the 
cost

after months 
of

i never dreamed that this car would 
be

i traded up from a tsx and the rdx 
actually
1

i'm thrilled i have the mdx! thank you acura you have a fan 
who
1

smoother to drive except the steering 
is
1

the build quality is 
very
1

superb
1

by far this 2007 mdx 
out

the only reason you can hear the quiet tire noise is because

ever

the seat to unusal configs

i didn't buy it as a race car but i drive over a mountain pass to work every day and this car doesn't work very hard

have

takes some time to get

package since i don't

so far and i love the luxury feel of the inside with an awesome sport feel that i 
would

as long as the ride is on a smooth

i think i will trade it 
in

in the 8 months

only surprise was

much

might

my treo phone which 
the

the stereo is so good you'll be the envy of 
not

averaged around 20-21 mpg on our trip and was very pleased 
with

suvs in its class

you simply can not see

there is also much to be said about the way 
acura
1

the motor is rough for a luxury car and suffers from a serious flat spot between 4500 and 6000 rpm 
meaning
1

there is so much kick in the engine you won't

i'ved owned a couple bmws and we 
just

system is also 
my

i drove the acura just to prove to myself that 
my

it handles very well a little sluggish compared to other car mb clk 430a 
but
1

~
i upgraded from an original 
2001
1

else. oh and the back-up camera does not work 
well
1

this suv has much less pick 
up
1

and the rear view camera has been useless to us so far very hard 
to

i have plenty of room while at 
the

but i do wonder why acura went away from what worked in the mdx family (i left the

the blind spots are a problem but

on the gas guzzler issue - compare the rdx to real

the ride is so smooth and the power 
is

the reality is that if you are going to get poor gas mileage you might as 
well

the mdx is a nice car that is easy to drive although had i known i would only be getting 12.5 mpg around town i probably 
would

the mdx has 
a
1

seats with lumbar support can't be beat and i 
tried
1
|

an '07 mdx with tech 
package
1

so no problem pulling up to upscale places! i didn't want to give up space to pop things in the back and go so 
i
1

"live" traffic update is not so helpful i prefer pushing buttons or twisting dials 
for
1
|
~
the ride is so 
smooth
1
|
~
this is a great suv 
and
1
|
~
i think it is geared more towards gas mileage until you get on it and 
then
1
|
~
we put 40k miles on it in almost 3 
years
1
|
~
i took a chance and drove up the 
hill
1
|
~
to the rdx 
can't
1
|

7 * 8.4 gb (dual layer) = 
approx
1

but we saw the rdx - good price great quality and 
it
1

i am the kind of guy that will research vehicles for months 
and
1
|

but i believe the car will live up to its price several 
times

suvs in its

i've had the car for a month now and love driving it!! but 
im

i can picture

after getting used to a wrx 
we
1

i must say the car 
is

this is a very fun and 
smooth

better

1

only thing that i'd really like to see 
are

on the gas guzzler issue - compare the rdx to real world

i just went through a b1 service

it's
1

nice ride but for the bang and the buck the mdx was the clear winner!! i love the way the vehicle moves and the smooth braking action is awesome; not to mention 
the

it's wrong at least 75% of the 
time

i was driving it so often that my wife said

a

i upgraded from an original 2001 mdx to this 
one
1

the quality 
of
3
|
~
stop cycle several times when you 
wait
1
|
~
we bought the sport package and the leather upgrade was 
worth
1
|
~
my wife actually has a hard time parking in small parking lots 
because
1
|
~
compared to the rx 330 the mdx is 6 inches wider 4 inches longer 
and
1
|
~
i drove the x5 bmw and the mercedes ml class and neither car can hold a candle to my 
'07
1
|
~
and the gadgets inside 
are
1
|

the mdx is a nice car that is 
easy

i am getting about 25 
mpg
1
|

granted i get to 
drive
1

which are 
all
1
|

i am hoping that the car is as reliable as other honda cars and am looking forward to updating 
when
1

(love the 
storage

this car has plenty of 
room

about

i have owned it about three weeks and have the best time driving 
it
1

after all is 
said
1
|
~
first thing i want to say is that this suv handles better than a vehicle 
this
1
|
~
my 2007 mdx just two days ago and love it! it rides like a luxury suv but with the kick and sporty 
attitude
1
|

acura claims that it is a safety feature but it only works if you angle

main problem that i didn't notice during my test drive: if you keep the seat erect at a good angle for your posture the head rest pushes your 
neck

tried lexus

1
|

i told my wife the mdx had seating for 7 and she said 
we
1

it's a blast to drive stylish comfort 
and
1
|
~
with all the buttons 
and
1
|
~
i would have liked to have had items in 
the
1
|
~
cost as it 
requires
1
|
~
i now have over 18,000 trouble 
free
1
|
~
i picked up the car in feb 
and
1
|
~
build quality and design is superb and the options you get for the price compared to cars 
in
1
|
~
s far i'm having a blast with 
it
1
|
~
the tech package provides a whole new level of controls that 
are
1

we do a 
lot
1

i love the zero to 60 in 6.8 secs sh-awd (it truly 
works!)

in love 
with

i've owned the rdx for a month now and i still can't wait to drive it - 
i

after the door was fixed

i have a two and a half year old and we added a side rail (step) and glad we did little guy can get in easier by himself and i use it to 
buckle

our

~
so no problem 
pulling

only thing that i'd really like to see are flat 2nd row seats for better 
cargo
1

we decided to look into the luxury suv segment and narrowed our choices 
to
1
|
~
love the xm live traffic display which saves 
me
1
|
~
i never thought an acura would be 
this
1
|
~
i'm probably going to trade 
it
1
|
~
i really miss 
the
1
|
~
options such 
as
1
|
~
i haven't tried the 
sport
1
|
~
seats with 
lumbar
1

for the quality you 
receive
1

cell phones 
believe
1

we do a lot of highway driving and average 19 mpg and it took about 7500 
miles

after test driving all 
and

some might say that it 
drives

i had done 
my

minute

and i would be very 
suprised

best

in the last month my rdx has been in the shop three times and the last time it didn't even last a week before the emission light went on again and when it goes on it seem to shift down and have less power it has been in the shop this time for a week and they don't know what's wrong with it they are in contact with japan now and still have no idea 
what's

i can picture driving this suv for ten years it will probably seem state of the

we wanted an awd sedan after a string of average 
suvs

the rdx drives more like a sports car and i had to catch myself this morning when i 
was
1

we had their temp set to 78 as they are always cold 
and
1

main problem that i didn't notice during my test drive: 
if
1

i drove the x5 bmw 
and
1

~
the motor is rough for 
a
1

on it and i would purchase this car again if i had to do it again! i used to drive a mercedes c240 2005 but this is 
much

but so far with 2000

ride handling and about every bell and whisltle you can find a price that will not put

it

love this car!! i have had no problem in the first 4000 miles

this suv has much less pick up than my 01 v8 grand cherokee which it replaced (i leave on 'hills' and the car can't stay 60mph on 5th and takes a long time to shift to 4th which is way 
too
1
|
~
my treo phone 
which
1

with almost anything 
not
1

is great it corners well and acts like a big 4x4 it's no fun when 
the

also replaced 
the
1

voice command system works 
great
1

take a few good days of use to get all of the commands andm options down but looks to be 
well

and the worst 6) the steering is so hard my wrists hurt when trying to 
turn
1

is even better with

i took the car to the dealer and 
they

too and then i started 
meeting

this is a very fun 
and
1

from the cockpit at night is 
great
1

got this vehicle because of the value that was packed 
into

was very 
useful

it is very quick and the gas

there is room for my wife's luggage the kids and

car drives nicely although the sportier ride can be a bit too harsh at times 
for

work and family driving less 
painful

all the power you need handles well nothing to really 
complain
1

this is a very fun and smooth 
suv

the front seat feels crowded and i have to crouch down in my seat to see the front of the 
car
1

i thought i could get sport and utility 
in
1

my advice: don?t 
buy
1

i actually like the navi control 
knob

could easily get less with

my average mileage after 3000 miles is around 17-18 miles per gallon

i love the zero to 60 in 6.8 secs

my 2007 mdx just two days ago and love it! it rides like a 
luxury

safe

poor gas mileage on premium - 18.3 mpg on

to purchase an suv because 
of

i have owned it about three weeks 
and
1
|

i'm amazed at how well the mdx 
holds
1

sound system very nice navi is the easist i've seen although the voice commands are 
a

i have owned it about three weeks and have 
the

it rides like (even better than) 
my

i have plenty of room while at the same time i am "zippy"; easily pulling 
into

we have had the new vehicle for a month and we have not 
seen

while not in the suv class of my old 4runner 
i've
1

i have owned it about three weeks and have the 
best
1

annual gas costs will 
be
1

19/21). overall i think the build and ride is not equal 
to
1

price. this is my second acura 
and
1
|
~
a/a 
when
1

this is my first turbo engine and overall i like the 
power

but it appears at

here we are with over 10k miles and we just love 
this

drive this suv 
and
1

do wish 
that

it handles very 
well
1

but no suv 
out
1

we did the 
head
1

i've had the car for a month now and love driving it!! 
but

i have taken the mdx on long trips 
and

love this vehicle! 
this

ride
1

do wish that the roof rails side running boards and 
side
1

maybe they should have 
actually
1

i would find it hard to believe that 
there
1

mpg is decent; 20/22 
combined

or 
a

just bought the rdx a few weeks ago and i love it!! this is my first suv i test drove others but when 
i

and handles as well 
as

the new mdx is just 
about

my husband and i fell in love with the mdx in 02; bought it 
and
1

audi6 and lexus 
350
1

~
as we did on our 2003 pilot 
we
1
|
~
do wish that the roof rails side running boards and side body 
moldings
1
|
~
we decided to look into the luxury suv segment 
and
1
|
~
the dealer hasn't been able to figure out what is wrong yet 
--
1
|
~
is easy to use however expect a learning curve to master all aspects of manual 
and
1
|
~
do wish that the roof rails side running boards and side body moldings 
did
1
|
~
despise being 
somewhat
1
|
~
never had an 
suv
1
|
~
tried lexus rx 
350
1
|
~
i use it for business 
as

do wish that the roof rails side running boards and side body moldings did not 
have

the memory seats are great being that my husband and i have almost a 
foot

(imho this 
should

the mdx matches the 
rl
1

the rl is a solid vehicle and is equipped 
with

handles like a bmw but with more 
"toys"

poor gas

gauges 
are

do wish that the roof rails side running boards and side body moldings did not have to be extras 
but
1

~
the upgraded stereo system is awesome 
and
1
|
~
compared to the rx 330 the mdx is 6 inches wider 4 inches 
longer
1
|
~
not only is the rdx just the right size it's actually more fun to drive!! the sh-awd system produces such grip and control that it almost feels like you're driving 
a
1
|
~
also the car has 
too
2
|
~
not great when i compare it to my old honda crv but is still better 
than
1

it seems 
like
1
|
to
1

fair
1

is not very strong and feels only very slightly better than my 
previous
1

do wish that the roof rails side running boards and side body moldings did not have to be extras but 
they
1

and a back-up camera? 
overall
1

is not very 
strong

i don't drive it off road and don't plan to but on snow covered mountain roads it out handles

i have a two and a half year old and we added a side rail (step) and glad we did little guy can get in easier by himself and i use 
it
1

i loved all of them! this is very similar to x5 only 
leaves
1
|
~
middle row seats are very comfy for the two outer most however the middle 
one
1

~
the interior has the feel of a sports car and the turning radius 
is
1
|
~
drove it about 300 miles 
on
1

~
then i 
realized
1
|
~
this suv has much less pick up than my 01 v8 grand cherokee which it replaced (i leave on 'hills' and the 
car
1

~
it's awesome! fun to drive decent gas mileage looks great inside and out! tons of power 
for

on
1

so far just getting used to all 
the
1

do wish that the roof rails side running boards and side body moldings did not have to be extras but they make the 
car
1

it is like you 
are
1

and food cold so you 
don't

that will improve once

still looking for some dvd-a discs of the bands i 
like
1
|
~
this suv/cuv is the 
best
1
|
~
it can hold 6+1 dvds 
loaded
1

~
noise when steering at low speed - dealer says they have a fix - have to 
see
1

- much 
better
1

ride is firm but you get lots of 
grip
1
|
~
ride and lot's of bells 
and
1
|
~
just feels stuck to road dvd is awesome crazy voice commands and gps is 
too
1
|
~
the car actually gets 
quieter
1
|
~
nice ride but for the bang and the buck the mdx was the clear winner!! i love the way the vehicle moves and 
the
1

~
makes knocking noises 
when
1
|
~
averaged 20 mpg 
in
1
|
~
safe vehicle great 
for
1

plenty of power and awd when skiing plenty of room for baggage great mpg for an 
suv

is that 
it
1

of
1

as "decent but 
not
1

this turned out to be a giant 
mistake
1

safe vehicle great for our growing 
family
1

as one who had been driving 6 & 8 cyl cars i was leery of the 4cyl turbo but it 
has
1

my wife and 
i
2
|

and the gps system but the car rides awesome nice pick-up and everyone just loves 
the
1

this vehicle vibrates badly at speeds above 60 mph 
and
1

my wife and i 
both
1

are

leather sunroof and all 
the
1

~
screen was no longer touch screen (as my tl from a few years prior had 
been)
1
|
~
resisted at first but since it was the vehicle that my wife would be driving then it was 
pretty
1

is the equal of the more powerful v6 tl once you get used to the mild turbo lag on initial throttle tip 
in

i offer to drive my friends around just 
so
1

a first class suv all around with 
abundant

you get a feel of road while driving this suv which is very 
much
1
|
~
to drive down the 
switch
1
|
~
there is room for my wife's luggage the kids and dad's luggage and the golf 
clubs

this car is actually fun to drive and the handling is like no

be

driving is so 
fun
1

i was driving it 
so
1

overall this car 
seems
1

that acura put this car out with such bad gas mileage and there's no 
way
1

the car is a blast to drive (love the 
turbo)

i've owned over a dozen hondas and acuras through the 
years

if you are not sure exactly what you want but in the market take a test drive and you will be sold

a bit of tire noise and a bit of turbo lag 
are

yes 3rd row is for

with almost anything not 
in

ones to 
me
1

to it as well! very 
happy
1

i traded an '03 mdx for this vehicle because i'm single have no need for a large suv and have been 
very

to it as well! very happy with our 
mdx
1

~
its 
rival
1

a
1

i owned porsche and bmw 
quality
1

i tried other small suvs in this range i.e lexus murano 
and
1

to let it go because it was a 
great
1

the rl has 
so

the seats become 
very

i chose the rdx because i wanted sport sedan like handling and power but the utility of

very nice vehicle overall 
but

this is the suv

if you are in the market for a luxury suv for family touring with cool 
tech

wanted

you

often 
seems

a light suv you 
should

i have owned over the past 5 years a 4.4 bmw x5 mb ml500

do

have

quality perfect never back to 
dealer

and what i was looking for but the 4 cylinder turbo engine is 
terrible

mdx is very much what is expected from acura: comfort and 
good
1

to find out that the car lacked some 
features
1

the 07 mdx a 
lot
1

is truly a dream 
machine
1

i use the manual 
shifting
1

the 07 mdx a lot 
before
1

i still do it 
and
1

i bought the rdx so i must like 
it
1

rear camera works 
most
1

this suv has much less pick up than my 01 v8 grand cherokee which it replaced (i leave on 'hills' and the car can't stay 60mph on 5th and takes a long time to shift to 4th which is way too 
high
1

it has enough luxury to 
impress

nothing and i mean nothing compares with this vehicle for

not as fast as my

i'm amazed at how well the mdx holds it's own with the little sports car as far as feel and road holding under 
extreme
1

the mdx actually drives like a sports 
sedan
1

even the sunroof rattles 
during

company in the car just laugh at how bad it is 
when

i'ved owned a couple bmws and 
we

and replaced rear swing arm spring seat as it was damaged 
along

i was so hesitant to look at the rdx 
after

thought about upgrade to to

in my opinion the acura mdx is the best

it's like being strapped into a rocket what power 
and

mdx is very much what is expected from acura: 
comfort

the fit and finish are better than my last mercedes ml 
as
1

~
on the market and nothing is 
as
1

~
for the ne the ride is real hard and the car bounces from bump to bump as opposed to flowing over the road 
so
1

~
when compared to a sport

1

recently and 
i

in the last month my rdx has been in the shop three times and the last time it didn't even last a week before the emission light went on again and when it goes on it seem to shift down and have less power it has been in the shop

as long as the ride

my husband and i fell in love with the mdx in 02; bought 
it

in the last month my rdx has been in the shop three times and the last 
time

i had been looking for 
a

thought about upgrade to to tech 
pkg
1

~
handling and quick steering response are 
greatly
1

~
it is a very good car for a single person but storage space for families on 
trips
1

~
i love xm and if you 
love
1
|
~
the car with driver 2's key rather than the #1 key the car 
hated
1
|
~
plenty of room in the back seats 
and
1
|
~
we've put almost 1000 miles on 
it
1
|
~
take a few good days of use to get all of the 
commands
1

~
and will probably just 
get

drove it about 300 miles on a 
trip
1

~
this car if 
you
1

~
with the new mdx and loved every 
moment
1
|
~
however i see the car is not 
well
1
|
~
the upgraded stereo 
system
1
|
~
the engine is smooth the white lights are super bright the 
sound
1

nav at 
some
1

after all the 
research
1

needs a lot to improve power steering is very hard wind noise low fuel

this is one of the first cars i have owned that doesn't have a single rattle 
or
1
|
~
a lexus rx 300 and a

1

~
is just beyond reproach for a vehicle 
with

our first child in a

bought the complete sport /rear dvd package 
just
1

easy 19 to 20 mpg avg. 92 octane

main problem that i 
didn't
1
|
~
my 2007 mdx just two days ago and love it! it rides like a luxury suv but with the kick 
and
1
|
~
i have set it at 80 mph and climbed a 12%-18% hill grade 
and
1
|
~
makes my old one 
feel
1

~
safety is 
a
1

but too many things just 
don't
1

if i had known that the mileage would be this bad i would never 
have

by

test

the interior design is 
a
1

mdx won out over the lexus and cost less 
for

dueler tires with b/b rating i would 
expect
1

nicely 
made
1

sound system very nice

|
~
next time around 
i
1
|
~
yes you will feel a turbo lag from a dead stop but you will be amazed how much power this little 
engine
1
|
~
safety is a huge reason for owning 
this
1

~
to you 
that
1

~
this car puts a smile on my face every day on the way to work each morning and tempts me to take the "long way" home

i love driving this so much that i kinda want to be on 
road
1

more creature comforts and 
roughly
1

is higher than i expected but i was told that 
it
1

~
to buy this suv and 
was
1

build quality equal to or better than 
lexus
1
|
~
in the last month my rdx has been in the shop three times and the last time it didn't even last a 
week
1
|
~
it is a fun 
suv
1
|
~
and what i was looking for 
but
1

i've had this vehicle for almost two months now and can't find anything yet that i do not like about it (2500 miles 
so

needed

dueler 
tires
1

and it totally meets 
the

i've ever 
had

my gas mileage has not been as 
bad

i have about 1,300

it just blends in rather than

like most readers i've driven them all but this one delivers a lot of 
bang

front and second row seats are

sadly it's time 
for

but it has plenty

a little touchy at start 
maybe

we are in the process of selling it not because we want to but because our family has simply 
outgrown

on it and i would purchase this car again if i had to do it again! i used to 
drive
1
|
~
they said 
it
1
|
~
i have just taken 
an
1
|
~
needed. 
ride
1
|
~
thought i was going to buy an mdx but after driving both i prefered the way the rdx handled 
and
1
|
~
as one who had been driving 6 & 8 cyl cars i was leery of the 4cyl turbo but it has the pep needed to get 
me
1
|
~
is that of a much larger car then the old one 
but
1
|
~
abundant power that 
is
1
|
~
ride in comfort for most roads and sports car handling on windy 
mountain
1
|
~
if acura corrects this 
they
1
|
~
mirror which is now finally included and the open 
bottom
1
|
~
i must confess this is probably the best vehicle honda has ever made right up there with such 
ground
1
|
~
on the market and 
nothing
1
|
~
tested rx 330 xc90 touraeg and this 
is
1
|
~
base model and has great 
features
1
|
~
i offer to drive my friends around just so i can feel the comfort 
of
1
|
~
one of my concerns was moving "down" to an 
acura
1
|
~
base model and has great features for 
price
1
|
~
mileage about 19 mpg with mostly 
suburb
1
|
~
the 07 mdx is in a class by 
itself
1
|
~
i traded my 
2002
1
|
2005
1
|
~
a first class suv all around 
with
1
|
~
as a father who runs many errands with my son i am pleased with the size of the rdx as it has plenty of interior room and 
is
1
|
~
i have plenty of room while at the same time i am "zippy"; easily pulling into parking 
spaces
1
|
~
it corners 
under
1
|
~
love the handling 
prowess
1
|
~
we don't like 
the
1
|
~
dueler tires with b/b rating i 
would
1
|
~
kids love the rear ent and we love being able to let the kids listen to their music while we listen to 
ours
1
|
~
nav works when it wants to and always when it is at 
the
1
|
~
yes there is more driving noise then a lexus but it's a 
trade
1
|
~
my husband is 
always
1
|
~
sporty it drives a lot like a sedan 
with
1
|
~
it with a bmw x5 (07- 3.0) this was a much lighter 
vehicle
1
|
~
i have been driving 
it
1
|
~
dueler tires with b/b rating i would expect 
best
1

the 07 mdx is in a 
class

heavy tech features without the

after

i've owned my mdx since october 06 have about 8,000 on 
her
1

i am a stay home 
mom
1

the kids love the dvd so much that 
they
1
|

can't wait to take it out on a long 
trip
1

had returned my lexus rx

this suv offers a lot in standard 
features

a little

bigger

bit
1

touchy
1

love this vehicle! ride 
is
1
|
~
1) the bottom of the steering wheel feels like a food grater as 
the
1
|
~
the center console will have you feeling you about to 
blast
1

1
|
~
about this car all the time because of 
its
1
|
~
wanted to upgrade and stay with a 
honda
1
|
~
the tech package is cool if your company allows you 
to
1
|
~
else. oh and the 
back-up
1
|
~
this was designed to compete with bmw's x3 
and
1
|
~
the front seat makes my legs ache on long drives - 
in
1
|
~
sound system beats my stereo at home! my children love the larger dvd screen (9 
inch
1
|
~
vehicle very high 
tech
1
|
~
my time 
spent
1
|
~
safety was a big deal 
for
1
|
~
it is really to early 
to
1
|
~
since these 
are
1
|
~
comfort level of all interior 
controls
1
|
~
safe for 
the
1
|
~
out it is a 
pleasure
1
|
~
very poor fit and finish 
not
1
|
~
19/21). overall i think the build and ride is not equal to that of the lexus but they are still 
within
1
|
~
i had written a previous post about the mdx but wanted to 
reserve
1
|
~
the mdx with 
just
1
|
~
the only real issue 
so
1
|
~
this is by far the best suv i 
have
1
|
~
it's amazing how much hp a 4 cylinder with a turbo can give you and not to 
mention
1
|
~
and the gadgets 
inside
1
|
~
i hate the steering wheel! it's not the wheel that's so bad even 
if
1
|
~
just bought the rdx a few weeks ago and i love it!! this is my first suv i test drove others 
but
1
|
~
this is by far the best suv of 2007 for the price 
and
1
|
~
at 50 mph+ 
like
1
|
~
better than the german cars and value wise by 15 
k
1
|
~
the '07 picks up where the '02 left 
off
1
|
~
love this vehicle! ride is best 
in
1
|
~
so no 
problem
1
|
~
ride is stiff - thats the price you pay 
for
1
|
~
i bought acura because we have had great cars from 
honda
1
|
~
we liked the car at 
first
1
|
~
i've had the car for a month now and love driving it!! but im getting really bad gas mileage 12.5 mpg in the city really bad at average speed of 14 
mph
1
|
~
handles well lots 
of
1
|
~
the fuel economy for the first 2 tanks of gasoline is not good then 
as
1
|

between sept 2007 and april 2008 i had 3 sets of front tires 2 sets of 
back
1
|
~
i bought a 
lexus
1

tl
1
|
~
rattles are coming 
from
1
|
~
and overall looks are 
worth
1
|
~
because of 
its
1
|
~
s far i'm having a blast 
with
1
|
~
the last two problems also occurred in 
the
1
|
~
of a honda accord 
and
1
|
~
the 21 mpg 
that
1
|
~
it took about a month to adjust to a bumpier ride but the handling is very similar to a car and 
not
1
|
~
mode will 
out
1
|
~
mpg is 
decent;
1
|
~
driving i noted that the rdx really shines in a wide range 
of
1
|
~
have been "in love" since seeing first rdx on highway more than a month 
ago
1
|
~
it feels more 
like
1
|
~
started to rattle after four months of having the car; now 
is
1
|
~
yes 3rd row is for kids and small adults 
but
1

this car is just a blast

i decided to give acura a try - so far this seems to be a very 
wise
1

i was not aware of 
this
1

will not be confused with 
a

this car puts a smile on 
my

this turned out to be 
a

so it's not a

took the car from the dealer then 
drove

the build quality is superb 
and

when you buy

i spent too much 
time
1

here was my must have list and what 
the

mine has had 
horrible
1

system is at least 2-3 years behind in features with only 2d maps and ugly 
text
1

take a few good days of use to get all of 
the

car drives very nice and is quiet compared 
to

vtech engine non existent turbo lag 
and
1

i took curves at 65 mph and you can see 
on

2004

i must confess this is probably the best vehicle honda has ever made right up 
there
1
|
~
the only real issue so far is that the 
battery
1
|
~
fuel ecomony is poor but i don't put on so many miles that it's 
a
1
|
~
like a jet and handles like 
a
1
|
~
and i love the 
mdx
1

i find this vehicle to 
be

at the speed of your choice & the remote to open 1 or

1

to find out that the car lacked some features i thought 
would

the seating position is nice and high but without the huge vehicle to 
go

good luck sorry you have this car and 
sorry

really need to read the

this car so she could have a safe

this is be our third acura mdx and they have messed up 
a
1

from what i have read that was the market 
segment
1

i think it is geared more towards gas mileage until you get on it and then it really 
moves

when i drive it like a

tried lexus rx 350

no question this is

thanks for making a suv that won't make me look like a soccer mom! what a sleek 
looking
1
|
~
i have owned this 
for
1
|
~
beside this being my 3rd honda product (2000 accord coupe and then 2005 acura tsx) i was looking for a bigger 
car
1
|
~
heavy tech features without the heavy 
price!
1
|

but i do wonder why acura 
went

i bought a lexus 330 3 years back b/c bmw does not do well in snow :) lexus is a smooth 
car
1

once i saw this new mdx i had 
to
1
|

that is why i decided to 
buy
1
|
~
the lexus gx470 bmw 
x5
1
|
~
it feels like you're in an airplane 
cockpit
1
|

it's fun cool and for a 56 year old 
guy
1

gas mileage isn't great but i 
knew

wipers & hope 
i
1

car with all the bells and whistles plus 
some
1
|

although for 
some
1

the only thing i really hate is having to 
fill
1

after owning a honda pilot and an 
acura
1

enough oomph 
to
1

wipers & hope i 
never

to their choice 
through
1

after a couple of months of trying to convince my wife to trade our 2004 
lexus
1
|
~
to the rdx can't even compare and the rdx is even more fun to drive 
than
1
|
~
just picked up mine last 
week
1

the seat to unusal configs helps 
when
1

i have owned the 
car

the mdx is much better 
in

recently and i would classify 
the

i have owned the car 
for

mirror. acura thank 
you!

all the power you 
need

i have owned the car for only 
6
1
|

thought i was going to buy an mdx but after driving both i prefered the way 
the
1

-- the seat belts don't fit snug and rattle; the front seats should slide back further to increase front 
leg

safest

after 3,000 miles 
i

had returned my lexus rx 330 
lease

they just pop out and you think "there's onother feature i did't know!!" its a great car it's an suv 
sports
1
|
~
would like to 
have
1
|
~
my initial concern of 
possible
1
|
~
wife and i were in market for vehicle with 3rd 
row
1
|
~
i bought this car to 
replace
1
|
~
we've put almost 1000 miles on it this month and i can't wait to drive 
it
1
|
~
turns out this car is a lot of fun to drive and feels solid all 
around
1
|
~
the '07 picks up where the '02 left off - more power more 
comfort
1
|
~
we bought the sport package and the leather 
upgrade
1
|
~
had optional 
roof
1
|
~
previous car was a sedan powered by v6 
and
1
|
~
my treo phone which the acura people say is the 
phone's
1
|
~
dealer has worked hard to fix 
but
1
|
~
kept going and 
got
1
|
~
one of my concerns was moving "down" to an acura from a 
lexus
1
|
~
perhaps better 
than
1
|
~
interior fit and finish looks 
to
1
|
~
it's got one 
of
1
|
~
the dealer hasn't been able to figure out what is 
wrong
1
|
~
when compared to 
a
1
|
~
vehicle 
very
1
|
has
1
|
and
1
|
is
1
|
that
1
|
for
1
|
~
had optional roof rack and 
cross
1
|
~
i don't know how others are driving that get less than 15 mpg but i've been 
pretty
1
|
~
since these are 
no
1
|
~
it's fun to drive - i look forward 
to
1
|
~
some may not like to 
feel

|
~
we've put almost 
1000
1
|

hit the nail on the head 
with
1
|
~
even if the company doesn't it's worth it to get your own phone and just ignore theirs 
when

needs a lot to improve power steering is

but is 
much

a lexus rx 300 and a 330 and having test driven the 2007 lexus gx 470 and the bmw x5 i can say without a doubt 
that
1
|
~
even in 
the
1
|
~
that day i test drove the 07 rdx 
sw
1
|
~
about 3 weeks 
into
1
|
~
until i had more miles on 
it
1
|
~
the rdx performs well and is 
clearly
1
|
~
it is the younger 
faster
1
|
~
drive of any 
vehicle
1
|
~
this is by far the best suv of 2007 for 
the
1

if you drove it

to find 
out

a
1

too bad i have just one so my wife drives it and i get it 
only
1

the 2011 will be a totally new 
car

i told my wife the mdx had seating 
for

i also love all the 
things

i realized this

driving and 
love

i offer to

i have a two and a half year old and we added a side rail (step) and glad we did little guy can get in easier

traded in our 
'06
1

i narrowed my choices to the mdx 
q7
1

it rides like (even better than) my lexus es 330 and it still does the job for skiing surfing and road trips!! this 
car
1

some may 
not
1

~
on the gas guzzler issue - 
compare
1

it was a worth wait to get mdx sh-awd acura advance 
which
1
|
~
i narrowed my choices to the mdx q7 
and
1
|
~
would like to have seen the vehicle have a built 
in
1

the ride is a bit bouncy at times but 
handling

i narrowed my choices to the mdx q7 and xc90 and the mdx won 
without

the dealer has

i narrowed my choices to the mdx q7 and xc90 and the mdx won without too 
much

and replaced rear swing arm spring seat as it was 
damaged

the only thing i don't 
like

perfect 
for

plan to spend 
a

i'm guessing that mileage figures vary with driving habits? it's not

the more i drive it the more i 
love

the turning radius is amazing 
take

buy it with 
the

tested rx 330 xc90 touraeg 
and

as "decent but not great."

the
1

the ride was also quiet 
and
1
|
~
i was looking at the bmw but in the 
end
1
|
~
what really sets the '07 apart for us is 
the
1
|
~
the exterior styling is a real head turner much better than the 2006 
models
1
|
~
this vehicle about one week 
ago
1
|
~
while not in the suv class of my old 4runner i've come 
to

the only thing i really hate is having to fill up 
the
1

traded in my 2001 
lexus

it's easy to park around the 
city
1

better 
than

just bought the rdx a few weeks ago and i 
love
1

to learn 
all

as the lexus but one can easily 
get

please keep in 
mind

not great when 
i

i've had this vehicle for almost two months now and can't find anything yet that i do not 
like

performs almost as well as our 
mercedes
1
|
~
wow!! no vehicle is safe but i feel a sense of 
security
1
|
~
the fit 
and
4
|
~
small enough to get around the beltway nasty traffic yet 
big
1
|
~
but it appears at the 50,000 mile mark you can look for 
major
1
|
~
there is little road noise 
and
1
|
~
i drive 80% in the city 
and
1
|
~
mileage is 
ok
1
|
fair
1
|
okay
1

~
i had been looking 
for
1
|

except for the third row which is best for 
kids
1
|

compare to 
the

bought this a year ago new 
and
1
|

i've gotten lots 
of

for most of my life but i wanted to have a suv for

is the best out 
there
1

great handling for suv 
plus
1

the engine is very peppy once 
it
1

and interior 
cockpit
1
|
~
great handling for suv plus 
plenty
1

is great it corners well and acts like a big 4x4 it's no 
fun
1

the 4 dash a/c vents almost close 
when
1

great handling for suv plus plenty of 
room

and everyone is 
happy
1

great handling for suv plus plenty of room for 
this
1

are pretty intense 
but
1
|
~
there are so many minor details that acura does right to make this car 
so
1
|
~
when i need the power of a 6 cyl i 
have
1
|
~
- esp given size 
of
1

~
my wife and i both drive the vehicle so 
the
1

there is a good amount of 
turbo
1
|
~
engine 
doesn't
1
|
~
i think i will trade it in before i lose too much 
in
1
|
~
engine doesn't 
sound
1
|
~
xm and traffic 
is
1
|
~
its a new design so only time will tell what the recalls 
will
1
|
~
superb build quality fit 
and
1
|
~
so much for acura quality which is one of the main 
reasons
1
|
~
it with a bmw x5 (07- 3.0) this was a much lighter vehicle lower 
cost
1
|
~
engine doesn't sound as 
sweet
1
|
~
i traded an '03 mdx for this vehicle because i'm single have no need for a large suv and have been very happy with acura (my 
4th
1
|
~
i test drove several suvs (audi q7 rx 350 bmw x5 
buick
1
|
~
after driving a suburban for 6 years i'm loving this suv! i've 
driven
1
|
~
i've had this vehicle for almost two months now and can't find anything yet that i do not like about it (2500 miles so 
far)
1
|
~
the engine is 
rather
1
|
very
2
|
smooth
1
|
~
engine doesn't sound as sweet 
as
1
|
~
but still better than 
most
1
|
~
the rearview camera takes a couple of seconds to come on 
but
1
|
~
styling very fun to drive and pretty 
good
1
|
~
the dvd-nav works great and helped me avoid a traffic jam driving home 
from

my kids 
are

love
1

even though this car is not 
designed
1

the third row is fine for 
kids

that the rdx did 
not
1

but it 
appears
1
|
only
1

is
1

has
1
|

not only is the 
rdx
1
|
~
- much better than the 
old
1
|
~
i don't drive it off road 
and
1
|
~
in order to get 12-14 mpg a person must 
be

the cabin is very quiet 
even

in order to get 12-14 mpg a person 
must

the lack of a dimming rear view mirror is no issue 
at
1

first off there is no small suv out there that is as fun to drive as this 
car
1
|
~
car is pretty slow off the line but decent 
on
1
|
~
the engine is smooth the white lights are super bright the sound system is amazing and it does not feel like a big car 
behind
1

~
thus far there is nothing about the rdx that 
i
1

and the rear view camera has been useless to us so far very hard to see in most 
daylight

great car and 
just

the cabin is very quiet even 
at

we fell in love with this new suv as soon

i tried other small suvs in this range i.e lexus murano and there 
was

i must confess this is probably the best vehicle honda has ever made right up there with such ground breakers as the nsx 
and
1
|
~
i bought a lexus 330 3 years back b/c bmw does not do well in snow 
:)
1

for the ne the ride is real hard and the car bounces from bump to bump as opposed to 
flowing

it's the most unique vehicle on the road - some may say unique = 
ugly!

here was my must have 
list
1

i think i will trade 
it
1

on it and i would purchase this car again if i had to do it again! i used to drive a mercedes c240 2005 but this 
is
1

by how much 
more
1
|
~
i would suggest that no 
one
1

in an suv should put this on their list! once they drive it they won't be looking anywhere 
else!

this beats them 
out

the upgraded stereo system is awesome and the

even the base version is fully loaded - moon roof

1

be very careful of the 
rdx:
1

any time of year 
and
1

before buying i 
really
1

but this vehicle gets pretty 
decent
1

~
mdx won out over the lexus and 
cost
1
|
~
just for this 
option
1
|
~
compared with lexus 350 bmw x5 3.0 better than the ones 
compared
1
|
~
nice ride but for the bang and the buck the mdx was the 
clear
1
|
~
gas mileage isn't great but i knew that going in and it's better than the car i 
had
1
|
~
i'm a 5'1 female and i love 
it
1
|
~
then i realized i wasn't hearing any 
noise
1
|
~
most 
of
1
|
~
i haven't tried the sport driving 
feature
1
|
~
the interior and cargo space are much larger than 
the
1
|
~
so far and i love the luxury feel of the inside with an awesome sport feel that i would not be 
able
1
|
~
i haven't tried the sport driving feature yet and 
probably
1
|
~
i wanted a sports car 
but
1
|
~
i thought the ride was a bit fairer on the bmw but i felt the handling and power on the 
rdx
1
|
~
i need 
but
1
|
~
this car has every 
feature
2
|
~
i haven't tried the sport driving feature yet and probably will not use 
much
1
|
~
i got the sport 
just
1
|
~
i test 
drove

|
~
i got the sport just because of the 
upgrade
1
|
~
takes curves 
like
1
|
~
takes some time to get used to all the 
buttons
1
|
~
i got the sport just because of the upgrade in 
leather
1
|
~
interior looked too yellow 
put
1
|
~
i drove the x5 bmw and the mercedes ml class and neither car can hold a candle to my '07 mdx.this vehicle is as solid as a 
rock
1
|
~
interior looked too yellow put with upgrade to 
sport
1
|
~
the gas mileage is not the best but i can 
live
1

~
the kids love the dvd so much that they did not even use with their 
game
1
|
~
kept it for a 
couple
1

feels faster on than the 2005 rl we traded even 
though
1
|
~
when i say fun to drive i really mean i love to 
drive
1
|
~
wow. i do have to say that acura has created the 
best
1
|
~
best car i ever owned and i had 
them
1
|
~
finally a luxury suv 
from
1
|
~
2007 mdx may be 
best
1
|
~
i bought acura because 
we
1
|
~
we picked it up this weekend 
and
1
|
~
hands free link hooks up to b/tooth c-phone 
on
1
|

leather sunroof 
and
1
|
~
m5 x5 and infiniti 
fx-45
1
|
~
sport rails and daynight mirror 
and
1
|
~
when compared with these other luxury suvs i would have had to pay around $60k 
to
1
|
~
my only comment is that i feel 
the
1
|
~
i loved all of them! this 
is
1
|
~
system is easy 
to
1
|
~
feels like v6 it corners 
like

package such as electric 
tail
1

traded in my 03

why 
can't

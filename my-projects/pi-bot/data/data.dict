this suv has much less pick up than my 01 v8 grand cherokee

so much for acura quality which is one of the main reasons i traded in my saab 9-5 for

about how fun it would be to

the car was far superior to the tsx (in

i can picture driving this suv for ten years it will probably seem state of

this suv has much less pick up than my 01 v8 grand cherokee which it replaced (i leave on 'hills' and the car can't stay 60mph on 5th and takes a long time to

with all the good there are some things 
missing

fast so 
i
1

i do not drive crazy 
or

however my gas mileage is really 
bad
1

even if the company doesn't it's worth it to get your own phone and just ignore 
theirs

than what i would expect from a luxury car trim and paint quality is no better than the 
paint

that the rdx 
could

did

the rear seats do fold down for a very flexible interior and abundant 
cargo
1

okay there was another 
sort

and very good i might add; classy; standard - even without the bmw lexus 
or
1

except for the third row which is best for kids under 
4'
1

but still better than most if not 
all
1

so no problem pulling up to upscale places! i didn't want to give up space to pop things in the back and go so i keep the third seat 
down

in the last month my rdx has been in the shop three times and the last time it didn't even last a week before the emission light went on again and when it goes on it seem to shift down and have less power it has been in the shop this time for a week and they don't know what's wrong with it they are in contact with japan now

vehicles so think 
about

seems 66 mph is the sweet spot for best mpg on the 
highway

compared with lexus 350 bmw x5 3.0 better than the ones

had a heavier honda

any time of year

be very careful of the

in an suv should put this on their list! once they drive it they won't be looking anywhere

great car and 
just
1

and the rear view camera has been useless to us so far very hard to see in most 
daylight
1
|

thus far there is nothing about the rdx that 
i
1

the engine is smooth the white lights are super bright the sound system is amazing and it does not feel like a big car 
behind
1

~
car is pretty slow off the line but decent 
on
1
|
~
first off there is no small suv out there that is as fun to drive as this 
car
1

the lack of a dimming rear view mirror is no issue 
at

the cabin is very quiet 
even

in order to get 12-14 mpg a person must

but besides that this car is very fun 
to

the rearview camera takes a couple of seconds to come on

the engine is one of the best and pulls strongly at

i've had this vehicle for almost two months now and can't find anything yet that i do not like about it (2500 miles so 
far)
1
|
~
the tech package provides a whole 
new
1
|
~
i traded an '03 mdx for this vehicle because i'm single have no need for a large suv and have been very happy with acura (my 
4th
1
|

engine doesn't sound as 
sweet
1

so much for acura quality which is one of the main 
reasons
1

superb build quality fit 
and

i am very itchy 
to
1
|
~
maybe a $90+k mercedes has 
it
1

its a new design so only time will tell what the recalls 
will
1

to convey the rdx's 
overall
1
|
~
xm and traffic 
is
1
|
~
engine doesn't 
sound
1
|
~
i think i will trade it in before i lose too much 
in
1
|
~
traded a 2004 tl and the 2007 tl is 
much
1
|
~
- esp given size 
of
1
|
~
worth the 
price
1
|
~
when i need the power of a 6 cyl i 
have
1
|
~
there are so many minor details that acura does right to make this car 
so
1
|
~
are pretty intense 
but
1
|
~
great handling for suv plus plenty of room for 
this

you can't please everyone but for me this car is what i consider to be an 
ideal
1

i've had the car for a month now and love driving it!! but im getting really bad gas mileage 12.5 mpg in the city really bad at average speed 
of

i've gotten lots 
of

the exterior is due for

kids

the third row is nice in a pinch 
for

fair

better

okay

to the body style and 
features
1
|
~
there is little road noise 
and
1
|
~
but it appears at the 50,000 mile mark you can look for 
major
1
|
~
wow!! no vehicle is safe but i feel a sense of 
security
1
|
~
not great when 
i
1
|
~
as the lexus but one can easily 
get
2
|
~
to learn 
all
1
|
~
the only thing i really hate is having to fill up 
the
1
|
~
i often have 
to
1
|
~
like the styling and comfort but there are 
things
1
|
~
this vehicle about one week 
ago
1
|
~
the exterior styling is a real head turner much better than the 2006 
models
1
|
~
it is a sedan and 
sports
1
|
~
i was looking at the bmw but in the 
end
1
|
~
the ride was also quiet 
and

you're

tested rx 330 xc90 touraeg

the turning radius is amazing

behind 
the

the more i drive it the more i 
love
1

i told my 
wife
1

i'm guessing that mileage figures vary with driving habits? it's not 
a
1

plan to spend 
a
1

perfect 
buy!!
1

for
1

family

the only thing i don't 
like

and replaced rear swing arm spring seat as it was 
damaged
1

bmw and mercedes with the price tag 
not
1
|
~
did a lot of 
research
1
|
~
i narrowed my choices to the mdx q7 and xc90 and the mdx won without too 
much
1
|
~
this is the first car i have owned that i have hit 100+ mph with! i love the interior of 
the
1
|
~
tires if i try to gun 
it
1
|

the ride is a bit bouncy at times but 
handling

1

i realized this 
vehicle
1
|
~
this is one of the first cars 
i
1
|
~
since buying this car i did drive a friend's 
g35
1
|
~
you almost want to turn down the stereo just so you can here 
the
1
|
~
ride is a 
little
1
|
~
i also love all the 
things
1
|
~
i told my wife the mdx had seating 
for
1
|
~
a slightly better mpg given the tsx comes with a 2.4 liter 4 cylinder engine however the 
tsx
1
|
~
if you drove it 
as
1
|
~
this is by far the best suv of 2007 for 
the
1
|
~
drive of any 
vehicle
1
|
~
it is the younger 
faster
1
|
~
the rdx performs well and is 
clearly
1
|
~
until i had more miles on 
it
1
|
~
about 3 weeks 
into
1
|
~
as a single male in his 30s i am the demo they 
were
1
|
~
that day i test drove the 07 rdx 
sw
1
|
~
even in 
the
2
|
~
a lexus rx 300 and a 330 and having test driven the 2007 lexus gx 470 and the bmw x5 i can say without a doubt 
that
1
|
~
phone in one min! 
my
1
|
~
but is 
much
1
|
~
for the ne the ride is real hard and the car bounces from bump to bump as opposed to 
flowing
1
|
~
needs a lot to improve power steering is 
very
1
|
~
even if the company doesn't it's worth it to get your own phone and just ignore theirs 
when
1
|
~
hit the nail on the head 
with
1
|
~
we've put almost 
1000
1
|
~
some may not like to 
feel
1
|
~
it's fun to drive - i look forward 
to
1
|
~
i don't know how others are driving that get less than 15 mpg but i've been 
pretty
1
|
~
had optional roof rack and 
cross
1
|
~
the dealer hasn't been able to figure out what is 
wrong
1
|
~
i was looking at the bmw but in the end i thought the 
rdx
1
|
~
perhaps better 
than
1
|
~
one of my concerns was moving "down" to an acura from a 
lexus
1
|
~
kept going and 
got
1
|
~
dealer has worked hard to fix 
but
1
|
~
my treo phone which the acura people say is the 
phone's
1
|
~
we bought the sport package and the leather 
upgrade
1
|
~
the '07 picks up where the '02 left off - more power more 
comfort
1
|
~
turns out this car is a lot of fun to drive and feels solid all 
around
1
|
~
i could not have bought a better 
car
1
|
~
thanks acura for a great 
suv!
1
|
~
we've put almost 1000 miles on it this month and i can't wait to drive 
it
1
|
~
tl was of course quieter but i am 
always
1
|
~
wherever you 
point
1
|
~
i bought this car to 
replace
1
|
~
after test driving nearly every car in 
its
1
|
~
wife and i were in market for vehicle with 3rd 
row
1
|
~
my initial concern of 
possible
1
|
~
they just pop out and you think "there's onother feature i did't know!!" its a great car it's an suv 
sports
1
|
~
i really do love 
the
1
|
~
a thing of beauty the paddle shifters are way better than shifting manually 
and
1
|
~
takes curves like a sports sedan - 
well
1
|
~
after 3,000 miles 
i
1
|
~
i recently traded my 01 
bmw
1
|
~
in design comfort 
and
1
|
~
system. fuel economy is 
good
1
|
~
so no problem pulling up to upscale places! i didn't want to give up space 
to
1
|
~
sound system very nice navi is the easist 
i've
1
|
~
i test drove several suvs (audi q7 rx 350 bmw x5 buick enclave chevy tahoe looked at the lr3 gmc 
acadia)
1
|
~
issues with cabin noise - there 
are
1
|
~
the 07 comes packed with new stuff from 
previous
1
|
~
a little bit of wind and road 
noise
1
|
~
i had high 
regards
1
|
~
it can't beat the infiniti g35x or the lexus 
is

the x3 was a nice car but would cost about $10k 
more
1
|
~
the back of the car produces a 
click
1
|
~
from what 
i
1
|
used
1
|
~
makes a loud thump when it starts and it can repeat 
the

from the second you 
open
1

great pickup on 
the
1

a/a when you buy other 
trim
1

much more nimbler than the mercedes ml class.) the ride is pretty good but not in 
the

it is the younger faster and more fun brother to my rx 330! the 
stereo
1

the center console will have you feeling you about to blast 
off

~
i have had my rdx now 
for
1
|
~
after driving a large suv for the last four years i am 
thrilled
1
|
~
main problem that i didn't notice during my test 
drive:
1
|
~
kept it for a couple 
years
1
|
~
i have owned the car for only 6 weeks 
and
1
|
~
driving. drove up 
to
1
|
~
my 2007 
mdx
1
|
~
if you are not sure exactly what you want but in the market take a test drive and 
you
1
|
~
i love this car! it feels secure 
&
1
|
~
after these were fixed 
the
1
|
~
if you are not sure exactly what 
you
1
|
~
does not drive quite as well as 
our
1
|
~
others just have a moving 
map
1
|
~
decided to buy a 07 acura tl type s instead of lexus is350 
and
1
|
~
it rides similar to my wife's 2006 honda accord but holds tighter through the 
turns
1
|
~
a lexus rx 300 and a 330 and having test driven the 2007 lexus gx 470 and the bmw x5 i can say without a doubt that the 2007 acura mdx - my very first acura - is the best suv i've ever driven and much more fun than driving 
a
1
|
~
of value fun and luxury in 
suv
1
|
~
although for some 
reason
1
|
~
the car with driver 2's key rather 
than
1
|
~
but it has plenty of 
power
1
|
~
yes the ride is stiff but 
it's
1
|
~
with mercedes and 
bmw
1
|
~
so far i have owned 
the
1
|
~
i didn't buy it as a race car but i drive over 
a
1
|
~
takes curves like 
a
1
|
~
there is some turbo lag but once the turbo winds up you're pressed to the back 
of
1
|
~
if you are in the market for a luxury suv 
for
1
|
~
to use the turbo 
as
1
|
~
be 
very
1
|
sure
1
|
lost
1
|
trained
1
|
~
but it appears at the 50,000 mile mark you can look for major 
issues
1
|
~
it's just like a sport sedan and i 
like

i've had the

before

road noise and rattles are the biggest issues with this model 
and
1

~
after looking at the 
2007
1
|
~
this is my 5th acura 
and
1
|
~
we park the car boasts a new 
ding
1
|
~
we coud ever 
have
1

also am hearing a series of thud 
sounds
1

that is why 
i
1

~
i am the kind 
of
1

~
the right front door started to rattle the next 
day
1

the center console will have you feeling you about 
to

the first big snow will make you smile because you'll feel safe and secure knowing you'll 
get

it is like you are on

~
i take it out of 
the
1
|
~
my average mileage after 3000 miles is around 17-18 miles per gallon both city and 
highway
1

the right front door started to rattle 
the
1

even though this 
car
1

an mdx tech 
with
1

i had my 
previous
1

~
all i can say is this is a 
true
1
|
~
safest 
suv
1
|
~
-- the seat belts don't fit snug and rattle; the front seats should slide back further to increase front 
leg
1
|
~
thought i was going to buy an mdx but after driving both i prefered the way 
the
1
|
~
i have owned the car for only 
6
1
|
~
all the power you 
need
1
|

mirror. acura thank 
you!
1
|
~
i have owned the car 
for
1
|
~
recently and i would classify 
the
1
|
~
the mdx is much better 
in
1
|
~
i have owned the 
car
1
|
~
just bought the rdx a few weeks ago and i love it!! this is my first suv i test drove others but when i drove this i 
was
1
|
~
the seat to unusal configs helps 
when
1
|
~
also the rear seats do fold down so who ever said they didn't must not own the vehicle which they posted a review 
about
1
|
~
to the rdx can't even compare and the rdx is even more fun to drive 
than
1
|
~
with close 
to
1
|
~
whoa! is this thing 
fast!!
1
|
~
wipers & hope i 
never
1

middle row seats are very comfy 
for

~
enough oomph 
to
1
|
~
after owning a honda pilot and an 
acura
1
|
~
i love this car so 
much
1
|
~
the only thing i really hate is having to 
fill
1
|
~
coming from a truck based 
sport
1
|
~
plus fully loaded w/ nav for $5k less than lexus or bmw with navi and has great 
(honda)
1
|
~
car with all the bells and whistles plus 
some
1
|
~
wipers & hope 
i
1
|
~
not too 
soft
1
|
~
it's fun cool and for a 56 year old 
guy
1
|
~
would love it and 
my
1
|
~
the lexus gx470 bmw 
x5
1
|
~
that is why i decided to 
buy
1
|
~
once i saw this new mdx i had 
to
1
|
~
wheel is asinine with lumpy bits here and there to grab and the bottom 
of
1
|
~
stop cycle several times when you wait 
for
1
|
~
the mdx ride 
features
1
|
~
it to my wife's lexus es 300) 
but
1
|
~
but i do wonder why acura 
went
1
|
~
heavy tech features without the heavy 
price!
1
|
~
beside this being my 3rd honda product (2000 accord coupe and then 2005 acura tsx) i was looking for a bigger 
car
1
|
~
i have owned this 
for
1
|
~
thanks for making a suv that won't make me look like a soccer mom! what a sleek 
looking
1
|
~
pack in august 
2007
1
|
~
no question this is 
a
1
|
~
tried lexus rx 350 
and
1
|
~
when i drive it like a 
4
1
|
~
i think it is geared more towards gas mileage until you get on it and then it really 
moves
1
|
~
this is be our third acura mdx and they have messed up 
a
1
|
~
i have had my 07 mdx for about 2 months now i love the thing from its fun 
to
1
|
~
really need to read the

i had a suv with a 
v8

i don't 
need

want

regret

know

the seating position is nice and high but without the huge vehicle to 
go
1
|
~
my gas mileage has 
not
1
|
~
lots to 
read
1
|
~
at the speed of your choice & the remote to open 1 or 
all
1
|
~
this car is actually fun to drive and the handling 
is
1
|
~
tires if i 
try
1
|
~
school 
and
1
|
~
the engine is rather 
quiet
1
|
~
seats with lumbar support can't be beat and i tried them 
all
1
|
~
though one thing 
i
1
|
~
i bought acura because we have had great cars from honda but this isn't 
built
1
|
~
is good for such a 
heavy
1
|
~
the fuel economy 
is
1
|
for
1
|
~
2007 mdx may be best 
car
1
|
~
i find this vehicle to 
be
1
|
~
be. so i test drove the tl and wow what a car! granted it's not 
quite
1
|
~
and i love the 
mdx
1
|
~
like a jet and handles like 
a
1
|
~
fuel ecomony is poor but i don't put on so many miles that it's 
a
1
|
~
it may not be very sexy 
to
1
|
~
the only real issue so far is that the 
battery
1
|
~
i must confess this is probably the best vehicle honda has ever made right up 
there
1
|
~
i look forward 
to
1
|
~
& fun to drive than the 
2004
1
|
~
compared with lexus 350 bmw x5 3.0 better than 
the
1
|
~
i am into 3rd 
week
1
|

on a drive across 
the
1

& fun to drive than 
the
1

good job 
acura!
1
|

the car pulls more 
once
1
|
~
if maximum comfort is what you seek 
you
1
|
~
dealer says not sure what 
problem
1
|
~
i took curves at 65 mph and you can see 
on
1
|
~
car drives very nice and is quiet compared 
to
1
|
~
mine has had 
horrible
1
|
~
here was my must have list and what 
the
1
|
~
i spent too much 
time
1
|
~
i had a 2006 bmw 5 series and this car great compared to 
it's
1
|
~
when you buy 
rdx
1
|
~
the build quality is superb 
and
1
|
~
10,000 miles into my silver tl type-s with 6 speed manual and i figure i 
would
1
|
~
purchase and both my wife and i are very 
pleased
1
|
~
i used to average 16.9 mpg with my 4.7 
l
1
|
~
fuel average 
is
1
|
~
took the car from the dealer then drove 2000 
miles
1
|
~
the owner said i 
would
1
|
~
he's pretty happy i didn't budge on 
my
1
|
~
are pretty 
intense
1
|
~
as a side note i test drove the 07 g35 awd 06 
tl
1
|
~
this vehicle vibrates badly at speeds above 60 mph and has noise issues 
with
1
|
~
don't drive it like 
one
1
|
~
my initial 
concern
1
|
~
my average mileage after 3000 
miles
1
|
~
seat for shorter driver 
(5'3")
1
|
~
great sound quality & 
easy
1

some thing but there's just so much inside you tend 
to

took the car 
from

they are when my little 
suv

|
~
is perfect as per acura's 
usual
1
|
~
the car looks a lot better in person than 
in

oh well.) 
so
1
|
~
dealer has worked hard to fix but the factory 
sent
1
|
~
tilt 
down
1

power is just fine for 
a

system comes with a very old map and 
poi

- brakes 
and

i bought this

very
1

i wanted daytime running light side airbags great sound system alarm 
good
1

owned an '05 tl and told the dealer i'd buy a new one when they dropped the 
rl's
1
|
~
room. fuel economy on the 
sticker
1
|
~
i do not notice any turbo 
lag
1
|
~
the sh-awd system coupled with the manual shift 
mode
1
|
~
and ride quality you want toys for 
the
1
|
~
so far - 
acura
1
|
~
it's easy to park 
around
1

one day i was 
driving

22 mpg meaning 
mixed

under normal everyday driving it's flawless but 
try

the '07 picks up where the 
'02
1

the back of the car produces a click 
sound
1

a first class 
suv
1
|

the sound is ported through the am 
radio
1
|
~
easy 19 
to

really enjoyed the xm radio and 
the
1
|
~
front 
grill
1
|
&
1
|
seats
1
|
and
1
|
~
driver seat comfort 
and
1
|
~
and they just don't match the feel 
of
1
|
~
love it 
&
1
|
~
was very useful in 
the
1
|
~
audio systems 
and
1
|
~
power is just 
fine
1
|
~
when compared with 
these
1
|
~
except for the third row which 
is
1
|
~
as we did on our 2003 pilot we will be very 
happy
1
|
~
and could not be 
more
1

~
the standard rdx 
comes
1
|
~
i've put 27,000 miles on this car in 
less
1
|
~
best vehicle we have 
ever
1
|
~
finally a luxury suv from acura with 
good
1
|
~
system is at least 2-3 years behind in features with only 2d maps and ugly text for street names 
3)
1
|
~
i went from a 2005 nissan 350z to this sweet 
ride
1
|
~
handling (sh-awd and ads) very safe feeling vehicle very good 
engine
1
|
~
took a 600 mile road trip and several coastal 
drives
1
|
~
cargo space could be a little larger but larger 
space
1
|
~
purchase and both my wife and i 
are
1
|
~
a ride around 
the
1
|
~
even though tsx is fwd 
you
1
|
~
i had high regards for 
acura
1
|
~
in holding 
the
1
|
~
them with a 
laundry
1
|
~
test drove lexus is 250 
and
1
|
~
front and second row seats 
are
1
|
~
in snow! we've had a week 
of
1
|
~
this turned out to be 
a
1
|
~
this car puts a smile on 
my
1
|
~
will not be confused with 
a
1
|
~
i was not aware of 
this
1
|
~
for the price this car is too much 
fun
1
|
~
this car is just a blast 
to
1
|
~
the tl has a 
totally
1
|
~
started to rattle after four months of having the car; now 
is
1
|
~
have been "in love" since seeing first rdx on highway more than a month 
ago
1
|
~
driving i noted that the rdx really shines in a wide range 
of
1
|
~
mode will 
out
1
|
~
love this car!! i have 
had
1
|
~
it took about a month to adjust to a bumpier ride but the handling is very similar to a car and 
not
1
|
~
of a honda accord 
and
1
|
~
s far i'm having a blast 
with
1
|
~
the back seat is small yet the seats 
fold
1
|
~
the drive by wire is great and the torque is a 
nice
1
|
~
this car before any 
other
1
|
~
it drives very 
well
1
|
smooth
1
|
~
because of 
its
1
|
~
yes it gets 
between
1
|
~
and overall looks are 
worth
1
|
~
i bought a 
lexus
1
|
tl
1
|
~
between sept 2007 and april 2008 i had 3 sets of front tires 2 sets of 
back
1
|
~
i suspect the main knock is that you are 
paying
1
|
~
plus fully loaded w/ nav for $5k less than lexus 
or
1
|
~
the fuel economy for the first 2 tanks of gasoline is not good then 
as
1
|
~
handles well lots 
of
1
|
~
we liked the car at 
first
1
|
~
i only use 
car
1
|
~
i enjoy that my husband talked me 
into
1
|
~
ride is stiff - thats the price you pay 
for
1
|
~
so no 
problem
1
|
~
while the g35 and 
is
1
|
~
gas mileage is great too on a 500 mile road trip i averaged 34 mpg! 
this
1
|
~
love this vehicle! ride is best 
in
1
|
~
better than the german cars and value wise by 15 
k
1
|
~
at 50 mph+ 
like
1
|
~
just bought the rdx a few weeks ago and i love it!! this is my first suv i test drove others 
but
1
|
~
and the gadgets 
inside
1
|
~
it's amazing how much hp a 4 cylinder with a turbo can give you and not to 
mention
1
|
~
a lot of the bells and whistles of the rl faster and more stable 
than
1
|
~
the only real issue 
so
1
|
~
for a brand new car usually it takes time for the engine to break in and get 
the
1
|
~
but there is a noise coming from the brakes they have tried to fix 4 times and can't get it to go away for more than about 2 days at a 
time
1
|
~
the mdx with 
just
1
|
~
i had written a previous post about the mdx but wanted to 
reserve
1
|
~
19/21). overall i think the build and ride is not equal to that of the lexus but they are still 
within
1
|
~
very poor fit and finish 
not
1
|
~
out it is a 
pleasure
1
|
~
comfort level of all interior 
controls
1
|
~
since these 
are
1
|
~
it is really to early 
to
1
|
~
5 of 
my
1
|
~
my time 
spent
1
|
~
vehicle very high 
tech
1
|
~
sound system beats my stereo at home! my children love the larger dvd screen (9 
inch
1
|
~
as a side note i test drove the 07 g35 awd 
06
1
|
~
the front seat makes my legs ache on long drives - 
in
1
|
~
it's the most unique vehicle on the road - some may say unique = ugly! takes a while to learn the tech 
stuff
1
|
~
this was designed to compete with bmw's x3 
and
1
|
~
added roof rack - solid metal rack and sport running boards as well as 
d/n
1
|
~
else. oh and the 
back-up
1
|
~
this car has a lot of items equipped 
as
1
|
~
the tech package is cool if your company allows you 
to
1
|

about this car all the time because of 
its

test 
on

|
drove
5

drive
1
|

steering wheel could go another inch i'm 6'1" 
just

while the overall interior 
quality
1

the center console will have you feeling you about to 
blast

turbo lag 
is

love this vehicle! ride 
is
1

a little 
in
1

bigger

bit
1

touchy
1

this suv offers a lot in standard 
features
1

the kids love the dvd so much that 
they
1

the only thing i really hate is having 
to
1
|

i've owned my mdx since october 06 have about 8,000 on 
her

i really like the feature when you unlock 
it

as one who had been driving 6 & 8 cyl cars i was leery of the 4cyl turbo but it has the pep needed to get

thought i was going to buy an mdx but after driving both i prefered the way the rdx handled

but

it is a fun 
suv
1

to buy this suv and 
was
1

is higher than i expected but i was told that 
it
1

the design is becoming a little dated and the redesign should 
be
1

more creature comforts and 
roughly
1

i love driving this so much that i kinda want to be on 
road

was

i didn't have to test drive any other

i loved my fx but

it's like being strapped into a rocket what power

love this vehicle! this is my 4th acura

don't think i could find another car this size i would love

car. it comes fully loaded for a not so loaded 
price
1

in my opinion the acura mdx is the best 
value
1

thought about upgrade to to 
tech

i was so hesitant to look at the rdx 
after

i'm amazed at how well the mdx holds it's own with the little sports car as far as feel and road holding under

if you travel and you are in the car for many hours a day this is

i also test drove the x5 
4.4
1

this is an awesome 
machine
1

~
is nice & stiff and it has a great turning 
radius
1

also need to exchange low profile tires for winter tires (in new england) or i will not be able to navigate in the snow - i spent most of my 
first
1

the 07 interior is much nicer than 
the
1

nothing and i mean nothing compares with this vehicle for 
the
1

it has enough luxury to 
impress
1

this suv has much less pick up than my 01 v8 grand cherokee which it replaced (i leave on 'hills' and the car can't stay 60mph on 5th and takes a long time to shift to 4th which is way too 
high

if you want a well

it's easy to park around the 
city

i still do it 
and

got a couple blind spots off both sides that i need to work 
on

is truly a dream 
machine
1

~
the 07 mdx a 
lot
1

but haven't noticed it - lucky for a nice stereo system so i'll just crank it up!! the low fuel warning is a bit annoying since it comes on with 4 gallons 
to
1

to find out that the car lacked some 
features
1

mdx is very much what is expected from acura: comfort and 
good

and what i was looking for but the 4 cylinder turbo engine is 
terrible

in love with this car! 
gorgeous
1
|
~
acuras are rare in germany and i get stares all the time by 
curious
1

the tech gadgets function well but you have to take 20 hours to read the manual to learn how 
to
1
|
~
very easily (again ne has pot 
holes)
1
|
~
i bought the car on january 2007 have test driven x5 fx45 and lexus; however this mdx 
has
1
|
~
i have taken it on a 
few
1
|
~
sound system is by 
far
1
|
~
this car offers more for the money 
than

for

you really can't go wrong 
with

wow is all i 
can
1

"live" traffic update is not so helpful i prefer pushing buttons or twisting dials for commands rather than 
voice

the interior and cargo space are much 
larger

hands free link hooks up to

not

decision

the main drawback 
is

i have the tech package 
and
1

the exterior styling is a 
real
1

i can picture driving this suv for 
ten
1
|

suvs and you'll 
find
1

and i have never been so 
pleased
1

is standard on 
this
1

~
beats 
every
1

~
vtech engine non existent turbo lag 
and
1
|
~
part of the vehicle is its 
interior
1
|
~
with the fold down seats i can haul a 
lot

worth the price over a 
base
1
|

amazing on gas for size & 300hp! 
ride
1

so no problem pulling up to upscale places! i didn't want to give up space to pop things in the back and go so i keep the third

i've gotten about 5500 miles on

this is the first japanese suv we have had 
in
1

i test drove audi g7 lexus gx470 
volvo

nice ride but for the bang and the buck the mdx was the clear winner!! i love the way the vehicle moves and the smooth braking action is awesome;

makes knocking noises when both speed and rpm are low as if it were 
a

middle row seats are very 
comfy

if you drive it hard 
your
1

lexus and bmw i went with acura for their resale value and the fact that you get 
more
1
|

being a female i find most of the suvs are too big and too heavy 
for
1
|

type-s best 
deal
1

leather seating 
is

too. my kids fit easily and safely and the gas mileage is aok

gas mileage has been between 18 & 19 mpg and

i've had my mdx for about 4 months now and it's a fabulous vehicle all the

also no more second 
guessing

this is my second mdx - the first being an '02 touring model with 
nav
1

drove high end mbz 
and
1

cockpit is way

this vehicle is a big step up from the '02 model: more power better handling (doesn't feel

the car is a blast to drive (love the

that acura put this car out with such bad gas mileage and there's no 
way

overall this car 
seems

lincoln. mpg is ok average around 24 in mix driving 
and

driving is so 
fun

i will probably 
trade-up

to drive down the

you get a feel of road while driving this suv which is very

i find myself using two hands on

pretty
1

after nearly a year i'm still very happy with my 
tsx

screen was no longer touch screen (as my tl from a few years prior had 
been)

my wife and i 
both

this vehicle vibrates badly at speeds above 60 mph

and the gps system but the car rides awesome nice pick-up and everyone just loves

the reality is that if you are going to get poor gas mileage

safe vehicle great for our growing

this turned out to be a giant 
mistake

this is my first tl 
and
1

as "decent but 
not
1

averaged 20 mpg 
in

nice ride but for the bang and the buck the mdx was the clear winner!! i love the way the vehicle moves and 
the

sport mode tranny is neat but 
not
1

it looks like a 
suv

ride and lot's of bells 
and
1

like the mp3 hookup so i can connect 
my
1

ride is firm but you get lots of 
grip
1

i have had the car for 2 weeks now and i do not regret any part of 
my
1

~
- much 
better
1
|
~
this vehicle should 
have
1
|
~
noise when steering at low speed - dealer says they have a fix - have to 
see
1

~
it can hold 6+1 dvds 
loaded
1

this suv/cuv is the 
best
1

still looking for some dvd-a discs of the bands i 
like
1

went with the tl-s because it was bigger and more roomy than the 
is

do wish that the roof rails side running boards and side body moldings did not have to be extras but they make the car look so much 
better

that will improve once

it's awesome! fun to drive decent gas mileage looks great inside and out! tons of power 
for

this suv has much less pick up than my 01 v8 grand cherokee which it replaced (i leave on 'hills' and the 
car

then i 
realized
1

drove it about 300 miles 
on
1

the fuel mileage did improve after the break in period and is 
now
1
|
~
i loved all of them! this is very similar to x5 only 
leaves
1
|
~
i have a two and a half year old and we added a side rail (step) and glad we did little guy can get in easier by himself and i use 
it
1

i didn't buy it as a race car but 
i
1

do wish that the roof rails side running boards and side body moldings did not have to be extras but they 
make

and a back-up camera? 
overall
1

not great when i compare it to my old honda crv but is still better 
than
1

~
also the car has 
too
2

not only is the rdx just the right size it's actually more fun to drive!! the sh-awd system produces such grip and control that it almost feels like you're driving 
a

do wish that the roof rails side running boards and side body moldings did not have to be extras

1

wish it gave better fuel economy but if you 
can

am

the rl is a solid vehicle and is equipped 
with

the mdx matches the 
rl

(tl more like bmw 5 
series
1

i'm not a fan of the wheels but like the color they are nicer in person 
than

but there is a noise coming from the 
brakes

hp. this is probably the best buy out there right 
now

the dealer hasn't been able to figure out what is wrong yet

we decided to look into the luxury suv segment 
and
1

a lexus rx 300 and a 330 and having test driven the 2007 lexus gx 470 and the bmw x5 i can say without a doubt that the 2007 acura mdx - my very 
first

do wish that the roof rails side running boards and side body 
moldings

with the windows up no fan running and no one else in the 
car

yes it had a luxury ride and feel but wasn't quite what 
i

honda corp only tell me they can try and "have it fixed" it's been in 7 times in 8 months! i 
stopped

my husband and i fell in love with the mdx in 02; bought it 
and

systems 
are

the new mdx is just 
about

and handles as well 
as

just bought the rdx a few weeks ago and i love it!! this is my first suv i test drove others but when 
i

ample power when needed good 
fuel

mpg is decent; 20/22 
combined
1

you get a lot for the 
money

i would find it hard to believe that 
there

maybe they should have 
actually

owned a 1998 honda accord 4cyl which i had clocked 190k+

from the test drive to the drive home to the drive way this is the most exciting car

i had planned to

wrong this 
is
1

turbo lag is not bad; spools up faster than the 2008 cx7 and 2009 subaru 
forester
1

wouldn't want to give up any of the fine handling 
that
1

the car handles well has 
more

i told my wife the mdx had 
seating

but it appears at 
the
1

the gas mileage is not the best but i can live 
with

i have owned my mdx for about

a little in the 
cargo
1

the gas mileage is not the 
best

it rides like (even better than) my lexus es

has all the features you want: memory seats leather blue

but you get what

this is my first turbo engine and overall i like the 
power

a/a 
when

price. this is my second acura 
and

to

while not in the suv class of my old 4runner 
i've

i have plenty of room while at the same time i am "zippy"; easily pulling 
into

i have owned it about three weeks and have

i would suggest the 07 acura tsx to any 
one

not as smooth as my

sound system very nice navi is the easist i've seen although the voice commands are

i'm amazed at how well the mdx 
holds
1

~
i have owned it about three weeks 
and
1
|
~
it's the most unique vehicle on the road - some may say unique = ugly! takes a while to 
learn
1
|
~
to purchase an suv because 
of
1

~
controls and 
the
1

just looking to test drive the rdx and ended taking 
one
1

poor gas mileage on premium - 18.3 mpg on 
mostly

handling (sh-awd and ads) very 
safe

my 2007 mdx just two days ago and love it! it rides like a

my average mileage after 3000 miles is around 17-18 miles per gallon

fun

i first 
noticed
1

i actually like the navi control 
knob
1

moves well and gas mileage that won't make you 
mad
1
|
~
my advice: don?t 
buy
1
|
~
i thought i could get sport and utility 
in
1
|
~
the front seat feels crowded and i have to crouch down in my seat to see the front of the 
car
1

drives and feels better 
than
1
|
~
until i had more miles 
on
1
|
~
all the power you need handles well nothing to really 
complain
1

~
this is the baddest car for 
money!!
1

car drives nicely although the sportier ride can be a bit too harsh at times

the x3 was a nice car but 
would
1

got this vehicle because of the value that was packed

is even better with

first things first imo the bmw e39 is superior to the tl in all

and chose this car for it's the most balanced

i love the back up camera & the

a lexus rx 300 and a 330 and having test driven the 2007 lexus gx 470 and the bmw x5 i can say without a doubt that the 2007 acura mdx - my very first acura - is the 
best
1

the motor is rough for a luxury car and suffers from a serious 
flat
1

you can carry lots of people and/or stuff and have a whole

however after reading mediocre reviews on the

system and i must say that i am happy with 
my

i compared the type 
s

first off there is no small suv 
out
1

in the world 
of

i haven't tried the sport driving feature

i had an a4 1.8t and

we were previous owners of an rx8 and making the switch to an suv/cuv 
we

middle row seats are

i wanted an awd for the northern il winters and the

some might say that it 
drives

i drive a prius to work because i can get into the hov i can't wait for the weekends to

after test driving all 
and

we do a lot of highway driving and average 19 mpg and it took about 7500 
miles
1

for the quality you 
receive
1

i wouldn't trade it for the 
more

options such 
as

it's wrong at least 75% of the time 5) when

i never thought an acura would be 
this
1

it has stone hard 
economy

my husband and i fell in love with the mdx in 02; bought it and when we 
needed
1

better than expected mpg 
to

love the xm live traffic display which saves 
me
1

so no problem 
pulling

the nav system is very easy to use 
and
1

i'm sure a sports car purist would find plenty to gripe about but it's not a sports 
car
1

performs almost as well as 
our

i have a two and a half year old and we added a side rail (step) and glad we did little guy can get in easier by himself and i use it to

after the door was fixed

i've owned the rdx for a month now and i still can't wait to drive it -

save yourself 15'000 and get a type s

we do a

the tech package provides a whole new level of controls that 
are

s far i'm having a blast with

build quality and design is superb and the options you get for the price compared to cars

after a couple of months of trying to convince my wife 
to

i picked up the car in feb 
and

i now have over 18,000 trouble 
free

cost as it 
requires
1

with all the buttons 
and
1

it's a blast to drive stylish comfort 
and
1

~
i told my wife the mdx had seating for 7 and she said 
we
1
|
~
tried lexus 
rx
1
|
~
main problem that i didn't notice during my test drive: if you keep the seat erect at a good angle for your posture the head rest pushes your 
neck
1
|
~
had the car for a year 
now
1
|
~
notice how i said "car" - it 
does
1

the front seat makes my legs ache on long drives - in 
fairness

at the time (about 
20

added roof

this car is actually fun 
to

acura claims that it is a safety feature but it only works if you angle 
the
1

this vehicle over all of the others 
from

my 2007 mdx just two days ago and love it! it rides like a luxury suv but with the kick and sporty 
attitude
1

i am no 
computer
1

i drove the x5 bmw and the mercedes ml class and neither car can hold a candle to my

you could ask for

this is a full sport utility vehicle and 
a
1

21 mpg all 
around

we do a lot of highway driving and average 19 mpg and it took 
about

- much better than the old model but not any better than others such as the 
new
1

vague and 
twitchy
1

and this car?s appeal made me give-up my beloved 
accord

an mdx tech with

with highway driving i get close to 23 mpg but when driving 
around

due to short in hands free link and took dealer 2 
times

improved overall 
from

the only thing i really hate is having to fill 
up

kids also love being able to bring the game cube

and the worst 6) the steering is so hard my wrists hurt when

no dummy light for washer

why pay $40k for a car with

i bought acura because we have had great cars from honda but this isn't built nearly as well as 
my
1

it seems fair compared 
to

the more you drive it the more 
you
1

with the speed

makes a loud thump when it starts and it can

watch out for the awd status display on the dash; you

is easy to use however expect a learning curve to master all 
aspects
1

i would have to sum up to say 
that
1

had an 01 cl and traded in 
for
1

great 18" michelin tires and the superb stereo system is a joy to 
listen

really enjoyed the xm radio 
and

tip for those who do not

points that clinched my decision 
to

it has good 
fit

took the car from the dealer then drove 2000 miles over the past 3 
weeks

the bmw and lexus didn't have the tow power or 
enough

i drove a bmw prior to this and loved it but i am 
thrilled

power is just fine for a 
vehicle

this car gives me to pull into another lane and pull away from somebody

i had a 2005 tl with navi and i was waiting for the new 
improved
1
|
~
only thing that i'd really like 
to
1
|
~
listen to the sample dvd that 
comes
1
|
~
we've put almost 1000 miles on it this month and 
i
1
|
~
how crips it handles 
for
1
|
~
is higher than 
i
1
|
~
granted i get to drive it much faster than i could in the 
states
1
|
~
save yourself 15'000 and get a type s it feels like it 
should
1
|
~
the new nav system is cool with the backup camera when you put 
it
1
|
~
when i first drove the new '07 model it seemed too big 
and
1
|
~
being a female i find most of the suvs are too big 
and
1
|
~
nice ride but for 
the
1
|
~
but haven't noticed it - lucky for a nice stereo system so i'll just crank it up!! the low 
fuel
1
|
~
one no memory seats what's up with that this 
is
1
|
~
the front seating 
areas
1

handling is good 
but

it

if you are in the market for a luxury suv for family touring with cool tech toys to play with mdx 
can't

this one 
is

|
however
1
|
seems
1
|
~
i narrowed my choices 
to
1
|
~
great brakes great looks and more features than any other car! i am hooked for a long time 
with
1
|
~
the stereo and 
nav
1
|
~
i didn't buy it as a race car but i drive over a mountain pass to 
work
1
|
~
she drives like 
a
1

as the a6 the type-s is a whole lot more fun 
and

is like 
driving

a
1

mickey
1

~
or in ?sport mode? mdx 
will
1
|

i chose the rdx because i wanted sport sedan like handling and power but the utility of 
an
1
|
~
i bought the car on january 2007 have test driven x5 fx45 and lexus; however this 
mdx
1
|
~
if you pay this 
much
1
|
~
you don't have to think twice before buying mdx because it's got the whole nine 
yards

test drove the lexus is 350 bmw 335i 
and
1

resisted at first but since it was the vehicle that my wife would be driving then 
it
1

~
i recently traded my 01 bmw 
x5
1

when i say fun to 
drive
1
|
~
if you are in the market for a luxury suv for family 
touring
1
|
~
nav at some 
point
1
|
~
first thing i want to say is that this suv handles better than a vehicle this large 
and
1
|
~
you only need to feather the gas pedal and the turbo will 
move
1
|
~
also have a 2003 g35 which i'm 
thinking
1
|
~
mpg for one 
year
1
|
~
to 70 mph to merge with 
55mph
1
|
~
i have taken it on a few long trips and am also very happy 
with
1
|
~
this suv has much less pick up than my 01 v8 grand cherokee which it replaced (i leave on 'hills' and the car can't stay 60mph on 5th and takes a long time to shift to 4th which is way too high 
rpm)
1
|
~
the mdx is a nice car that is easy to drive although had i known i would only be getting 12.5 mpg around town i probably would 
have
1
|
~
after months of careful research and test drives at bmw 
lexus
1
|
~
the build quality is very good with a few 
minor
1
|
~
tl was of course quieter but i 
am
1
|
~
are few 
but
1
|
~
it's easy to park around the city the back up 
camera
1
|
~
nav is by far better than lexus and you can fully use it 
while
1
|
~
but there is a noise coming from the brakes they have tried to fix 4 
times
1
|
~
resisted at first but since it was the vehicle that my wife would be driving then it was pretty much 
her
1
|
~
and the value 
is
1
|
~
the 21 mpg that i am 
getting
1
|

rocks and you rarely need to touch any of the menu buttons so long as you know 
the

although the

i feel as if this vehicle is a bargin even at 
msrp!
1

is that of a much larger car then the 
old
1

and will 
probably
1

scoff at anything other 
than

the interior controls are 
well
1

tag to 
high
1

i also test 
drove

larger engine gives it a little more power but the interior fit and

i chose the rdx because i wanted sport sedan like handling 
and

then there is 
a

the tech gadgets function well but you have to take 20 hours to 
read

i just traded my beloved infiniti fx for this 
mdx
1

braking are superb and rival my 
wife's
1

i'm amazed at how well the mdx holds it's own with the little sports car as far 
as
1

~
i drove a bmw prior to this and loved 
it
1

may be better in one category or another but overall none is 
even

even though tsx is fwd you 
can
1

the only problems is that with this 2007 the bumper front

the epa is 19/23 but thus far we have had no

took the car from the dealer then drove 2000 miles over the 
past
1

the ride is a 
bit
1

i never thought of being so happy of a honda over 
the
1

~
to buy 
this
1

the
1

ability and better brakes this 
car
1

and drove all kinds of cars but nothing 
like
1
|
~
the lexus rx (nice not sporty 
enough)
1
|
~
as a side note i test drove the 07 g35 awd 06 tl (a spec and 
stock)
1

~
the exterior could be better but still 
very
1

i can visibly feel very well the shifting of gears

the interior design is a little star trek for me but 
once

which cost 
me

she drives like a 
dream
1

to drive love the interior 
and

mileage is okay for a heavy

middle row seats are very comfy for the two 
outer

designed
1

do get the cooler

but haven't noticed it - lucky for a nice stereo system so i'll just crank it up!! the low fuel warning is

the sound that 
comes

are

a unique

i settled on the mdx without a doubt in 
mind
1

~
a lexus rx 300 and a 330 and having test driven the 2007 lexus gx 470 and the bmw x5 i can 
say
1

~
lots of techno gizmos to keep 
you
1

we have ridden

it is the most fun car

this is my fourth acura (2 tls 2 mdxs) and i've

i just traded in my 2002 mdx for the new 2007 mdx and am about to trade again! the new car 
is
1

~
notice how i said "car" - it does not drive like a 
suv
1
|
~
i didn't have to test drive any other after i test drove the 
mdx
1
|
~
i hope resale is as good on this as it was on my 
tl
1
|
~
is just beyond reproach for a vehicle with this size 
and
1
|
~
granted i get to drive it much faster than i could in the states but even at 120 mph it was 
rock
1

in the last month my rdx has been in the shop three times and the last time it didn't even last a week before the emission light went on again and when it goes on it seem to shift down and have less power it has been in the shop this time for a week and they don't know what's wrong with it they are in contact with japan now and still have no 
idea
1
|
~
lets go buy 
the
1
|
~
a lot of rattles inside 
cabin
1
|
~
it turns out that the rdx has a much nicer interior 
and
1

i settled on the mdx without 
a

:d! i 
love

and then 
you
1
|
~
i have three kids ages 14 12 and 9 
and
1
|
~
bottom line - 
best
1
|
~
this vehicle should have made with a 6 spd 
manual
1
|
~
a thing of beauty the paddle shifters are way better than 
shifting
1
|
~
resisted at first but since it was the vehicle that my wife would 
be
1
|
~
best vehicle we have ever 
owned!!
1
|
~
get one and have 
fun

after a couple of months of trying to convince my wife to trade our 2004 lexus gx 470 i finally wore 
her
1
|

i'd like 
to
1
|
~
i thought based on the price of 
the
1
|
~
is a 3+ mpg gap in rated numbers 
versus
1
|
~
acuras are rare in 
germany
1
|
~
with it is minimal but all for now i can observe and suggest that acura improve 
the
1
|
~
by far this 2007 mdx out performs all the 
above
1
|
~
the only problems is that with this 2007 the bumper 
front
2
|
~
this is my fourth acura (2 tls 2 mdxs) 
and
1
|
~
i drove the x5 bmw and the mercedes ml class and neither car can hold a candle to my '07 mdx.this vehicle is as solid as a rock yet moves like a light 
jet

suv on steroids the ride is superb and the agility witht ht sh-awd 
doesn;t

the motor is rough for a luxury car

reminds me very much of the older bmw 540 lots of torque and 
tons
1

i have plenty of room while 
at

it's also a good size for city driving and has all the oomph i

also need to exchange low profile tires for

before buying i really suggest taking the local roads rather than just hopping onto 
the

price. this is my second acura and it is every

too bad i have just one so my wife drives it and

plenty of power and awd when skiing plenty of room for baggage great mpg for an suv navi system is far

in the last month my rdx has been in the shop 
three
1
|
~
now i am back with the 2007 
mdx
1
|
~
we decided to look into the luxury suv segment and narrowed our choices to the bmw x5 
volvo
1
|
~
and drove all kinds of cars 
but
1
|
~
i'm not a fan of the wheels 
but
1
|
~
i just traded in my 2002 mdx for the new 2007 mdx and am about 
to

the

loved the balance in this car and costs a lot less than

nice ride but for the bang and the buck the mdx was the clear winner!! i love the way the vehicle moves and the

i am getting a robust 34-35

performs almost as well as our mercedes e class but has 
the

1

so i picked up my type s about 12 hours before writing this review boy it is 
one

i drove the x5 bmw and the mercedes ml class and neither car can hold a candle to

i had written a

wrong) replace the muffler (broken interior baffle) replace a 
rear
1
|
~
with almost anything not in the "super 
car"
1
|
~
i took curves at 65 mph and you can see on the display which wheel is getting power 
it
1
|
~
mileage is ok been getting an overall 
average
1
|
~
we need the awd 
for
1
|
~
kids also love being able to bring the game 
cube
1
|
~
interior looks and feels very nice and quality is heads above other suvs that i test 
drove
1
|
~
although it is small it is spacious 
inside
1
|
~
i don't want to go to work in the morning i 
want
1
|
~
and i would be very suprised if 
it
1
|
~
so far mpg 
has
1
|
~
out it is a pleasure to have all the 
extras
1
|
~
between the two was obvious from the moment you drive 
off
1
|
~
fuel economy? i'm getting 17-18 city 22-23 
hwy
1
|
~
after 10 yrs and 145,000 mi i sold 
my
1
|
~
but there is a noise coming from the brakes they have tried to fix 4 times 
and
1
|
~
the kids love the dvd so much that they did not even use with their game 
system
1
|
~
we got rid of our audi and went 
with
1
|
~
drivers side mirror does not tilt 
down
1
|
~
far better than any 
of
1
|
~
dueler tires with b/b 
rating
1
|
~
the new mdx is just about 
as
1
|
~
the ride is so smooth and the power is there when 
you
1
|
~
so the acura 
was
1
|
~
i've gotten about 5500 miles 
on
1
|
~
i got the sport just because of 
the
1
|
~
i read how good it was but you cannot believe 
it
1
|
~
yes you will feel a turbo lag from a dead stop but you will be amazed how much power this little engine has it really 
moves
1
|
~
i recently picked 
up
1
|
~
my third type s and the best 
one
1

the 2007 mdx a superb 
vehicle
1

i have owned this for a week 
now

also,if i 
get

thanks for making a suv that won't make me look like a soccer mom! what a 
sleek
1

with 12,000 miles on the tl: good points - 
the
1
|
~
we wanted a 
change
1
|
~
had returned 
my
1
|
~
it with a bmw x5 (07- 3.0) this was a much lighter vehicle lower cost & 
easier
1
|
~
there is room for my wife's 
luggage
1

equipped x5 
was
1

compared with 
my

i would like to see but overall i have yet to

the back of the car produces a click sound when any of the doors is 
shut
1

by the quality and features they've added to 
the
1
|
~
also have a 2003 g35 which i'm thinking 
of
1
|
~
i would find it hard to believe that there is a better midsize suv 
on
1
|
~
but when i looked at 
all
1
|
~
it is top quality vehicle can't beat 
it
1
|
~
also need to 
exchange
1
|
~
you can program it to 
lock
1
|
~
a slightly better mpg given 
the
1
|
~
it is a very good car for a single person but storage space for 
families
1
|
~
of places where else would you put them? 
there
1
|
~
with it is minimal but all for now i can observe and suggest that acura improve the ride 
with
1
|
~
i drive a prius to work because i can get into the hov i can't wait for the weekends to drive the 
tsx
1
|
~
honda has simply built an suv version of the 
acura
1
|
~
the tech gadgets function well but you have to take 20 hours to read 
the
1
|
~
that the rdx did not give 
me:
1
|
~
has a 
sporty
1
|
~
40k miles and no problems except 
for
1
|
~
so i picked up my type s about 12 hours 
before
1
|
~
it drives very smooth i have the dvd player and navi 
and
1
|
~
so far no regrets! i love the way people stare at my car at lights and in parking 
lots!

else about the 
suv

mark

went with the tl-s because it was bigger and

many people thought i was crazy but it was well worth

this suv has much less pick up than my 01 v8 grand cherokee which it replaced (i leave on 'hills' and the car can't stay 60mph on 5th and takes a long time to shift to 4th which is way too high rpm) - but slightly better gas mileage for a larger car (the onboard mile computer

safety is a huge

i was so hesitant to look at the rdx after i read

i opted for the 19" acura

bought the complete sport /rear dvd package just before the new

i had high regards for acura but after owning one for almost 2 
years

amazing on gas 
for

between sept 2007 and april 2008 i had 3 sets of front tires 2 sets of back tires and it drives worse 
than

but in the real 
world

this is the best 
of

the only thing i would change would be the shape of 
the
1

being an auto 
you
1

of a honda accord and my spouse's bmw 5 series sedan i think this 
is
1

i think it is geared more towards gas mileage until you get on it and 
then
1

this was a great feature for me because people 
at

about this car except that i have been

driving and love every minute of driving it! it's more like a sport sedan

do yourself a favor

the lexus was great but not

i have always bought acuras but this is one is a 
let

gas mileage is poor but it is an

this is the suv to own if you

about trading

you don't have to think 
twice

my wife would 
like

it took about a month to adjust to a bumpier ride but the handling is very similar to a car and not a 
truck

like
1

2007 mdx and what 
a
1
|
~
nothing and i mean nothing compares with this vehicle for the price 
paid
1

this is the first japanese suv we have 
had
1

also need to exchange low profile tires for winter tires (in new england) or i will not be able to navigate in the snow - i spent most of my first

in the last month my rdx has been in the shop three times and the last time it didn't even last a week before the emission light went on again and when it goes on it seem to shift 
down
1

and i would be very suprised if it doesn't win a 
lot
1

a lot and find it 
very
1

stick. dvd stereo is nice but only dvd music works and there are 
very
1

like the styling and comfort 
but
1

this is my second 
mdx

you can't 
please
1

beat
1

go
1

vehicles in the past 
and
1
|
~
just the right amount of power in my opinion but you have to be 
used
1
|
~
for the same items and options in others would have 
cost
1
|
~
safety ratings along with an alarm system 
that
1
|
~
the mdx is a very smooth ride easy to 
handle
1
|

but i believe the car will live up to its price several times over as 
many

i don't want to go to work in the morning i want to keep going!

since i adore

the 2007 is a 
little
1

3rd row legroom could be better

1

the number of features is immense and make it a car i hate to

this one seems quieter

about this car and plan on getting another one when my this lease

the mdx is a nice car that is easy to drive although had i known i would only be getting 12.5 mpg around 
town

i have owned my mdx for about 1 1/2 yrs & have loved every minute of driving the 24k problem free miles on it! it 
is

wish it gave better fuel

but you'll pay for the fun at 
the

a very basic bmw

drive it like a 6 cyl and you'll too complain about the 
gas

my mdx 
elite
1

the brakes seem a bit weak 
but
1

i would have to sum up to say that this vehicle is 
a
1

the dealer has 
not
1
|
~
handles like a bmw but with more "toys" and 
better
1

i love all the tech gadgets i 
am

you could 
ask
1

easily
1

however my gas mileage is 
really

for the ne the ride is real 
hard
1

last suv's were yukon xl and

i test drove the new g35 and well the acura can't quite beat the infiniti as far as straight off the line power however when it comes to the complete

its a new design so only time will tell what the recalls will be

it took about a month to 
adjust

powerful

i can't believe i am saying this but i love this vehicle! this coming from a man who wouldn't even consider an acura

it's also a lot better looking than

only have it for a month but so 
far
1

as a proud owner of hondas and acuras for over 30 years i can attest to the quality of the these very 
fine

can't figure out where they're coming from or how to make them

this vehicle about one week ago and couldn't

dealer has worked hard to fix but the factory sent 
them

i recently picked up my 
2007
1

i like the styling much more than the 09 grille has a richer more elegant look than 
the

the '07 picks up where the '02 left off - more 
power
1

nav works when it wants to and always when 
it
1

the x3 was a nice car but would 
cost
1

dealer says to wait until 2000 miles before bringing it 
in

hard. it corners better than any thing i have ever

the 07 mdx does drive so smooth and very fast 
that

it has been truly a 
great
1

fuel economy isnt all that great in the city 
but

honda corp only tell me they can

a lexus rx 300 and a 330 and having test driven the 2007 lexus gx 470 and the bmw x5 i can say without a doubt that the 2007 acura mdx - 
my

vehicle. took it on a cross 
country

rear camera takes 10 sec when backing up (making it much less

smoother to drive except the steering is so heavy it feels as if your are driving 
a
1
|

yes you will feel a turbo lag from a dead stop but you will be amazed how much power this little 
engine
1
|
~
this car has such a great takeoff and 
is

- we traveled with a baby 
&

i offer to drive my friends around just so i 
can
1

is amazing and easy to 
get
1

~
the x3 was a nice car but would cost about 
$10k
1

i also like the fact that i don't see

about the ride i have had 
cars
1
|
~
stereo is best short of audi a8 which runs 
$8,000
1
|
~
also the gps 
is
1

system is best in 
class
1
|
~
this car so she could have a safe reliable vehicle that could also be great for kids 
and
1
|
~
love it & would buy 
it
1
|
~
i love my new mdx it 
drives
1
|
~
although a honda man for 
over
1
|
~
gas mileage on last trip was over 24 mpg seems to improve with each 
trip
1
|
~
also need to exchange low profile tires for winter tires (in new england) or i will not be able to navigate in the snow - i spent most of my first winter at the bottom of 
my
1
|
~
i drove the x5 bmw and the mercedes ml class and 
neither
1
|
~
car to drive 
and
1
|
~
there is so much kick in the engine you won't even know 
it
1
|
~
as a side note 
i
1
|
~
the exterior styling is a real head turner much better 
than
1
|
~
at the expense of a smooth ride and a very 
poor
1
|
~
with it is minimal but all for now i can observe and suggest that acura 
improve
1
|
~
you can't please everyone but for me this 
car
1
|
~
i was leery about 
the
1
|
~
may be better in one category or another but overall none 
is
1
|
~
is great it corners well 
and
1
|
~
this car has plenty 
of
1
|
~
in the city 
i
1
|
~
wow!! no vehicle is safe but i feel a sense of security in 
my
1
|
~
i traded my 2005 
tl
1
|
~
there is a good amount of turbo lag making it feel sluggish from a start 
and
1
|
~
most do not happen all the time thus hard 
to
1
|
~
my land cruiser was too big my fx45 was 
a
1
|
~
one test drive will sell 
this
1
|
~
i find myself using two hands 
on
1
|
~
i looked at g35 and 
is
1
|
~
about this car all the time 
because
1
|
~
my mdx elite in 
sport
1
|
~
- much better than the old 
model
1
|
~
models. when i drove this car i 
knew
1
|
~
i love the interior 
design
1
|
~
if not the best vehicle for under $40k it has to be in the 
top
1
|
~
i am the kind of guy that 
will
1
|
~
before buying i really suggest taking the local roads rather than just hopping onto the closest freeway with no 
radio
1
|
~
i love this car! it feels secure & solid; the 
handling
1
|
~
do wish that the roof rails side running boards and side body moldings did not have to be extras but they make the car look 
so
1
|
~
well overall i give 
it
1
|
~
with acura for the 
last
1
|
~
ride 
with
1

made
1

comfort
1

very
1

if

although

on

in
1

handling
1

and
4
|
to
1

is

|
improved
1

with almost anything not in 
the
1

~
so take it for 
what
1
|
~
even when i am 
on
1
|
~
on it and i would purchase 
this
1
|
~
it is such a 
great
1
|
~
the '07 picks up where the '02 left off - more power more comfort and 
improved
1
|
~
after test driving a number of sedans i chose 
the
1
|
~
i drove a bmw prior to this and loved it but i am thrilled with my acura 
rl
1
|
~
so far and i love the luxury feel of the inside with an awesome sport feel that i would not be able to get from 
the
1
|
~
i compared the type s with 6 speed manual 
to
1
|
~
build quality and design is superb and the options you 
get
1
|
~
i have owned two hondas 
in
1
|
~
you have a luxury car for a great 
price
1
|
~
i can get about 25mpg highway 
with

else 
out

about

more

after the door was 
fixed
1
|
~
i have had the rdx for two months and think it is a 
blast
1
|
~
so no problem pulling up to upscale places! i didn't want to give up space to pop things in the back and go so i keep 
the
1
|
~
i've had my mdx for about 4 months now and it's a fabulous vehicle all the way 
around
1
|
~
shame on 
you
1

~
come on!!! a chevy 
has

at the time (about 20 
miles

if you are not sure exactly what you want but in the market take a test drive and you will be sold esp 
with

thanks acura for a

i am very itchy to 0-60 mph but the delivery guy told me i 
have
1
|
~
turbo kicks in 
real
1
|

tires seem 
to
1
|
~
ample power when 
needed
1
|

it just blends in rather 
than

bought an aberdeen green

i have owned two hondas in the past (civic and accord) and 
wanted
1

this suv offers a lot in standard features 
compared
1
|
~
but gas mileage was terrible and we had to replace the front brakes and rotors every 
5000
1
|
~
after a couple of months of trying to convince my wife to trade our 2004 lexus gx 470 i finally wore her down 
and
1
|
~
i chose mdx with tech 
package
1
|
~
while not 
as
1
|
in
1
|
the
1
|
~
i have taken the mdx on long trips and found 
the
1
|
~
the ride is 
smooth
1
|
solid
1
|
pretty
1
|
very
2
|
great
1
|
not
1
|
better
1
|
a
1
|
so
1
|
also
1
|
~
and more at 12-14k less than that 
european
1
|
~
system i love the els stereo though i 
still
1
|
~
someone 
talked
1
|
~
the navi system is a must for the 
price
1
|
~
while not the briskest off the line from 4000 rpm and above this beast will 
compare
1
|
~
with the windows up no fan running and no one else 
in
1
|
~
sound system very nice navi is the easist i've seen although the voice commands are a little rough so far for 
me
1
|
~
the center console 
will
1
|
is
1
|
~
and will probably 
just
1
|
~
yikes!!! the mdx sport handles better than top of the line porsche 
of
1
|
~
i have owned two hondas in the past (civic and accord) and wanted another honda but wanted more luxury than the 
pilot
1
|
~
kids also love being able to bring the game cube or ps2 and i 
just
1
|
~
but too many things just 
don't
1
|
~
kept it for a couple years and 
traded
1
|
~
my use of the car is limited to a 10 round trip commute to the office 5 
days
1
|
~
it with a bmw x5 (07- 3.0) this was a much lighter vehicle lower cost 
&
1
|
~
range. i came out of an audi 
a8
1
|
~
hp. this is probably the best buy out there right now when you 
consider
1
|
~
when compared with these other luxury suvs i would have had 
to
1
|
~
so the 
buying
1
|
acura
1
|
~
on it and i would purchase this car again if i had 
to
1
|
~
the engine is smooth the white lights 
are
1
|
~
thanks for making a suv that won't make me look like a soccer mom! what 
a
1
|
~
so much fun to drive it makes 
me
1
|
~
when i first drove the new '07 
model
1
|
~
the gas to keep up with 
traffic
1
|
~
gas mileage on last trip was over 24 mpg seems 
to
1
|
~
usable room 
and
1
|
~
(i test drove mazda cx7 bmw x3 ford fusion gmc arcadia) totally pale 
in
1
|
~
this vehicle is so much fun to 
drive
1
|
~
overall it's 
the
1
|
~
i bought the moroccan red car with the upgraded 
18"
1
|
~
this is my 1st suv and my 1st 
acura
1
|
~
stop cycle 
several
1
|
~
i just traded in my 2002 
mdx
1
|
~
between sept 2007 and april 2008 i 
had
1
|
~
i have never been so happy with a material item but i am smiling even when i 
am
1
|
~
leaks interior trim was never 
fastened
1
|
~
so the acura was the 
answer
1
|
~
i'm a realtor in colorado and went up 
to
1
|
~
this one seems quieter than the 1st 
gen
1
|
~
if you are in 
the
1
|
~
however i think the carbon grey or 
the
1
|
~
and the car is 
full
1
|
~
this car has all the luxury features 
that
1
|
~
for the ne the ride 
is
1
|
~
performs almost as 
well
1
|
~
could 
use
1
|
easily
1
|
~
i'm a 5'1 female and i 
love
1
|
~
nice ride but for the bang and the buck the mdx was the clear winner!! i love the way 
the
1
|
~
a lexus rx 300 and a 330 and 
having
1
|
~
rl 
does
1
|
has
1
|
~
stick. dvd stereo is nice but only dvd music works and there are very few of those and they won't work on regular cd 
players
1
|
~
don't get me wrong the 
car
1
|
~
i'm a realtor in colorado and went up to whale rock road in 
bellvue
1
|
~
it turns out 
that
1
|
~
that had multiple problems to an upgraded 
dream
1
|
~
i am glad that i test drove rdx 
within
1
|
~
the mdx is almost as nimble as the 
rx
1
|
~
(17 mpg mixed 
hwy
1
|
~
quirky 
styles
1
|
~
- it feels a little like the shocks but it 
isn't
1
|
~
i tried other small suvs in this 
range
1
|
~
i hope resale is 
as
1
|
~
comfort and value better than the 
tl
1
|
~
i must say the car 
is
1
|
~
when compared with these other luxury suvs i would have had to pay around $60k to get the 
same
1
|
~
there is room for my wife's luggage 
the
1
|
~
quiet refined full of gadgets 
and
1
|
~
bolt that made 
noise
1
|
~
great 18" michelin tires and 
the
1
|
~
i love xm and 
if
1
|
~
i bought the tech 
package
1
|
~
the turning radius is 
amazing
1
|
~
and ride quality you want toys for the kids room and 
comfort
1
|
~
that were 
not
1
|
~
is nice & 
stiff
1
|
~
which "wears 
down
1
|
~
bought this car because 
of
1
|
~
some thing but there's just so much 
inside
1
|
~
my rdx this week the day before 
a
1
|
~
rapidly. i am getting 22-23 
highway
1
|
~
and i also thanked myself for having the wisdom 
to
1
|
~
with a 
smartly
1
|
decent
1
|
lot
1
|
300
1
|
~
the fuel mileage did improve after 
the
1
|
~
i cannot wait for a long trip we are 
planning
1
|
~
about this vehicle is top tier fit 
and
1
|
~
wish it gave better fuel economy but if you can pay for the 
car
1
|
~
it's a blast to drive stylish 
comfort
1
|
~
the turbo is peppy but takes 
a
1
|
~
until then i 
dont
1
|
~
all the tech stuff is perfect the engine the tranny the leather the fit 
and
1
|
~
you can program it to lock in 30 60 or 
90
1
|
~
first let me just say that i have been a staunch fan of the bmw 3 series for years but i 
have
1
|
~
could easily get less with the peppy turbo if you stand 
on
1
|
~
7 * 
8.4
1
|
~
car is pretty slow 
off
1
|
~
we've put almost 1000 miles on it this month and i can't wait to drive it 
again
1
|
~
etc. we are coming from a bmw 528i wagon 
with
1
|
~
the engine is smooth the white lights are super bright the sound system is amazing and it does not feel like a big car behind 
the
1
|
~
i would have to say it's a touch noisy 
on
1
|
~
i have a two and a half year old and we added a side rail (step) and glad we did little guy can get in easier by himself 
and
1
|
~
lr3 and 
the
1
|
~
i wanted a small but very luxious suv and the acura 
rdx
1
|
~
is amazing and easy to get used to (my wife is not a tech geek at all and she is loving the nav blue 
tooth
1
|
~
i have had my 07 mdx for about 2 
months
1
|
~
is higher than i expected 
but
1
|
~
the ride is a bit bouncy at times but handling 
is
1
|
~
but a tire change might be 
in
1
|
~
so take it for what it's worth or 
upgrade
1
|
~
when compared to a sport 
x3
1
|
~
interior fit and finish 
looks
1
|
~
overall this car seems very 
good
1
|
~
interior looked too yellow put with upgrade to sport the leather 
looks
1
|
~
i have owned over 
the
1
|
~
nav works when it 
wants
1
|
~
to drive down the switch backs and snowy icey 
hills
1
|
~
the blind spots are a problem but once you know you are just 
extra
1
|
~
when compared with these other luxury suvs i would have had to pay around $60k to get the same 
amount
1
|
~
but it handles great drives smooth and quiet 
and
1
|
~
while i don't think 
this
1
|
~
safe vehicle great for our 
growing
1
|
~
i have had my 07 mdx for about 2 months now i love 
the
1
|
~
love the hard rear deck 
when
1
|
~
i ordered the rdx in may and received it in 
sep
1
|
~
i have really good image of honda also 
i
1
|
~
i thought the ride was a bit fairer on the bmw but i felt the handling and 
power
1
|
~
bought the sport with ent package 
in
1
|
~
best suv 
for
1
|
so
1
|
~
this one however has had 
annoying
1
|
~
but the squeaks and the little noises drive 
me
1
|
~
it rides like (even better than) my lexus es 330 and it still does the job for skiing surfing and road trips!! 
this
1
|
~
i have had my 07 mdx for about 2 months now i love the thing from its fun to drive 
to
1
|
~
the car is 100% made in japan which means 
it
1
|
~
what really sets the '07 apart for us is the handling 
on
1
|
~
rdx felt more 
powerful
1
|
~
for 300 
hp
1
|

only 
issue

i loved all of them! this is very similar to x5 only leaves 
$20,000

that

interior build quality is quite good; 
the

love my rdx - a suped-up honda with awd! all the bells and 
whistles

lots of reviews about the stiff 
ride

and the car is full 
of

love my rdx - a suped-up honda with awd! all the bells and whistles 
of
1
|
~
my wife and i both drive the vehicle so the custom seat mirror radio and phone book settings linked to each key 
are
1
|
~
with $4000 more than base tl you get all the options: navi brembo 
breaks
1
|
~
dealer took care 
of
1
|
~
in similar size cars; 2nd row seat buckles 
are
1
|
~
seats and dvd make it a 
nice
1
|
~
feels more than previous tls and steering feels much sportier and 
exact
1
|
~
i took a chance and drove up the hill without 
any
1
|
~
complex is easy to use and 
very
1
|
~
on this car is more towards handling 
than
1
|
~
no squeaks no 
rattles
1
|
~
plus you can 
get
1
|
~
the new mdx is just about as 
good
1
|
~
dealer took care of 
that
1
|
~
with the gl450 x5 gx470 
and
1
|
~
gives you 
a
1
|
~
dealer took care of that 
and
1
|
~
the car actually gets quieter over the break in period and it 
is
1
|
~
flawed as a 
family
1
|
~
all in all it's as near perfect as a 
car
1
|
~
be lost with 
a
1
|
~
easy 
19
1
|
to
7
|
~
the epa is 19/23 but thus far we have had no tank 
higher
1
|
~
with the speed and that's why i didn't realize 
how
1
|
~
is easy to use 
and
1
|
however
1
|
if
1
|
&
1
|
~
rdx felt more powerful than cx7 despite having 
less
1
|
~
i can't get much over 17 in 
the
1
|
~
and this car?s appeal made 
me
1
|
~
i never thought of being so happy of a 
honda
1
|
~
does not handle like a 5 series will not 
out
1
|
~
i told my wife 
the
1
|
~
seems 66 mph is the sweet spot for best mpg on 
the
1
|
~
and luxury 
comfort
1
|
and
1
|
~
package. the ride is rather sporty and 
bumpy
1
|
~
of - i end up all over 
the
1
|
~
fuel economy isnt all that great in the 
city
1
|
~
and lexus is 350 by far the best value and 
best
1
|
~
our 2001 lexus nav 
system
1
|
~
fuel economy isnt all that great in the city but on 
the
1
|
~
steering wheel could go another 
inch
1
|
~
do wish that the roof rails side running boards and side body moldings did not have to 
be
1
|
~
it drives very smooth i have the dvd player and navi and both 
are
1
|
~
please keep in mind that 
i
1
|
~
this car puts a smile on my face every day on the way to work each morning 
and
1
|
~
i looked into bmw x5 benz m350 
and
1
|
~
it comes with a 205hp engine which 
provides
1
|
~
i love pulling up to 
people
2
|
~
i replaced 
this
1
|
~
system comes with a very old map 
and
1
|
~
car. normal driving is smooth 
but
1
|
~
good cargo area - the rdx fit the bill for 
all
1
|
~
the rattling or problems 
others
1
|
~
fuel economy isnt all that great in the city but on the highway its very 
good

be. so i test drove the tl and wow what a car! granted it's not quite the road 
handler
1

i would like to see but overall i 
have

as i would like for such 
long
1

~
i wanted a sporty vehicle that was much quieter than my 
2005
1
|
~
and her decision 
was
1
|
~
system also does not 
take
1
|
~
package. the car handles the road like a sports car and fields the bumps just fine with minimal 
wind
1
|
~
and mpg to 
be
1
|
~
i used to drive a 2000 tl which got totalled recently as a truck hit me and rolled 
over
1
|
~
dealer has worked hard to fix but the 
factory
1
|
~
enough oomph to pass on the freeways of la and enough panache to park at 
your
1
|
~
side. the airbags 
worked
1

is a 3+ 
mpg
1

good luck sorry you have this car and 
sorry

my car

on the highway i 
get

combined
1

this car came with the extras 
that
1

and for $35k+ 
it
1

i love the looks and styling 
as
1

sadly it's time for a trade-in after only 5 
months
1

but so far

i test drove the new g35 and well the acura can't quite beat the infiniti as far as straight off the line power however 
when
1
|
~
maybe a $90+k mercedes has it beat but i didn't 
pay
1
|
~
dueler tires with b/b rating i would expect best quality for 
this
1

i never though i could find it in

great

i drove the x5 bmw and the mercedes ml class and neither car can hold a candle to my '07 mdx.this vehicle is as solid as a rock yet moves like 
a
1

my car is my 
office
1
|
~
yes it had a luxury ride and feel but wasn't quite 
what
1

i just traded in my 2002 mdx for the new 2007 mdx and 
am

at the speed of

so much for acura quality which is one of the

about

beside this being my 3rd honda product (2000 accord coupe and then 2005 acura tsx) i was looking for a bigger car than the tsx but 
still
1

the number of features is immense 
and
1

for the streets you can't do 
better

and obvi was a deal breaker for 
me

how crips it handles for size of

we just passed the 5,000 mile mark and the mdx is still 
the

the '07 picks up where the '02 left off - more power more comfort and improved body 
styling

i have owned my mdx for about 1 1/2 yrs & have loved every minute of driving the 24k problem free miles on 
it!

yes there is more driving noise then a

i am the kind of 
guy

the mdx actually drives like 
a

better! the sh-awd system is amazing: i feel glued to the road no matter how 
hard

was

this suv has much less pick up than my 01 v8 grand cherokee which it replaced (i leave on 'hills' and the car can't 
stay

hp. this is probably the best buy out there right now when you consider 
all
1

this vehicle is a big step up from the 
'02

is anything but 
nimble

the tech gadgets function well but you have to take 20 
hours

mode 
it's

this is the suv to own if you want

heated seats in the winter are

works! as long as you're not looking to haul anything

was

those looking for

company in the car just laugh at how bad it 
is

i only have 1k miles 
on
1

of acura & 
honda
1

skills due to the fancy 
back
1

i've had this vehicle for almost two months now and can't find anything yet that i do not like about it (2500 
miles
1

and launches the car 
out
1
|
~
i was going through 
the
1

entry is awkward seat and steering wheel take position when i get in the car rather than waiting until door is closed or car is 
started
1
|
~
i've owned my mdx since october 06 have about 
8,000
1
|
~
i chose this suv for a couple specific reasons: i needed a 
vehicle
1
|
~
is amazing and easy to get used to (my wife is not a tech geek 
at
1
|
~
the last acura i owned was a 91 legend coupe 
it
1
|
~
it has enough luxury to impress 
but
1
|
~
small enough to get around the beltway 
nasty
1
|
~
of - i end up all over the 
road
1
|
~
through the speakers & handling on 
this
1
|
~
went to acura and traded the 07 accord for the 07 
tl-type
1
|
~
quick corners nicely fuel economy could be better but then if i wanted fuel economy i should 
have
1
|
~
the third row is fine for kids or adults on short 
trips
1
|
~
even if i was willing to pay more for 
a
1

i was so hesitant to look at the rdx after i read all of the reviews 
about
1
|
~
i was going about 40 mph 
and
1
|
~
after months of careful research and test drives at bmw lexus 
volvo
1
|
~
i love this car! i haven't had it long 
but
1
|
~
with highway driving i get close to 23 
mpg
1

coming from a truck based sport utility this 
car

as well with a ride that makes

in the last month my rdx has been in the shop three times and the last time it didn't even last a week before the emission light went on again and when it goes on it seem 
to
1
|
~
as long as the ride is on 
a
1

~
cockpit is way too busy 
with
1

~
lots of techno gizmos to keep you busy for 
a
1

although some call it an suv 
it's
1

reach the 3rd 
row
1
|
~
move the seat all the time and it takes me a week 
to
1

~
the rdx v4 turbo is as good as any v6 guzzler suv you see in the market even better in 
some
1
|
~
i hate the steering wheel! it's 
not
1
|
~
for the ne the ride is real hard and the car bounces from bump to bump as opposed to flowing over the 
road
1

tried lexus rx 350 and bmw x5 
but
1

after all 
is

the

i have owned two hondas in the past (civic and accord) and wanted another

the key 
fob
1

~
the rl is the best kept secret 
of
1
|

loaded with standard features that are optional on other cars in the same 
class
1

~
the fit and finish on this vehicle is some of the bese i have ever seen having owned audi's and mercedes 
in
1

~
of the mid and 
high
1
|
~
awd suv and i would with no doubt 
buy
1

the steering is 
precise

tough
1

even the sunroof 
rattles

not

~
things shut off within 30 seconds of 
removal
1

due to its handsome 
styling
1
|
~
rapidly. i am getting 22-23 highway and 
11-13
1
|
~
much quieter interior than any previous 
tl
1
|
~
the road noise is a bit more than i would like and it is a stiff ride which some people don't 
like
1
|
~
the sh-awd system is terrific as you feel it pull you around 
sharp
1
|
~
bought it a week ago in 
ottawa
1
|
~
the type s was a perfect blend of what i wanted at good price point 
(with
1
|
~
i could not have bought a better car for a 
better
1
|
~
etc. we are coming from 
a
1
|
~
it's that it's 
loaded
1
|
~
the mdx with just about every luxury suv (ie x5 xc90) on 
the
1
|
~
i bought tsx a 
month
1
|
~
-- the seat belts don't fit snug and rattle; the front seats should slide back further to increase front leg 
room
1
|
~
i'm very happy and have had many vehicles before due to leases for work but i bought 
this
1
|
~
i have really good image of honda also i had acura rsx type s before and really 
liked
1
|
~
the fuel mileage did improve after the break in 
period
1
|
~
and the a/c blows 
cold
1
|
~
no problem with rattles except center speaker and only 
on
1
|
~
just picked up this 07 tls a week ago and think it's about the coolest thing going 
the
1
|
~
i love my acura but 
been
1
|
~
only thing that i'd really like to see are flat 
2nd
1
|
~
are so 
useful
1
|
~
i thought i could get sport and 
utility
1
|
~
glad i made the decision on 
the
1
|
~
i have had my 07 mdx for about 2 months now i love the thing 
from
1
|
~
1) the bottom of the steering wheel feels like a food grater 
as
1
|
~
and this car?s appeal made me give-up my 
beloved
1
|
~
i've gotten 
lots
1

about

|
~
but still 
has
1
|
better
1
|
~
we got 11mpg 
on
1
|
~
please keep in mind that i do about 70% highway 
driving
1
|
~
i've gotten about 5500 miles on it 
so
1
|
~
the rear brakes when i steered heavily in an attempt to get 
it
1
|
~
gas mileage isn't great but i knew 
that
1
|
~
in the rear view mirror low 
quality
1
|
~
is great! i love the seats 
too
1
|
~
the front seat feels crowded 
and
1
|
~
i have a two and a half year old and we added a side rail (step) and glad we did little guy can get in easier by himself and i use it to buckle him in 
without
1
|
~
the mdx is a very smooth ride easy to handle 
and
1
|
~
voice gadgets are 
awesome
1
|
~
for me was getting used to firmer sports seat than the bmw 7 series i was driving but i 
guess
1
|
~
it. most features 
were
1
|
~
in an suv should put this on their list! once they drive it they won't be 
looking
1
|

this is by far the 
best

1400 miles over 3 days and it worked better than my

i've only owned the vehicle for 1 
day
1

here we are with over 10k miles and we just love this 
suv
1

but it is the most fun you can have for the money and 
still

also am hearing a series of thud sounds when shifting 1st to 2nd with 
little

we also have a 2008 infiniti g35 and i am much

i love this car and was dreaming about it for 
more

looked at a long list 
of

the rdx drives more like a sports car and i had to catch myself this morning when i was doing 90 mph without even feeling 
like

this may be because the engine needs to break in but with my last acura (mdx) getting poor gas milage

reviews and then 
i
1

plan 
to

i could just sleep in my 
car!
1

i drove the x5 bmw and the mercedes ml class and neither car can hold a candle to my '07 mdx.this vehicle is as 
solid
1

beside this being my 3rd honda product (2000 accord coupe and then 2005 acura tsx) 
i
1
|
~
even though i live in new york city i don't plan on getting lost much 
any
1

will consume just about the same amount of gas for a 4cyl as a 6cyl tl the tsx lacks 
power

i've only had it for 
a

spot on

the 15 mpg i 
was

i had it for about 1 month now and it fits like a glove drives smooth put the pedal to

1

i upgraded from an original 2001 mdx to this one and 
am
1
|
~
i bought acura because we have had great cars from honda but this isn't built nearly as well as my wife's 
odyssey
1
|
~
i had done my research against lexus audi toyota 
and
1
|
~
wiper system on the driver side which the dealer can't seem to address (fluid dribbles 
onto
1
|
~
gas mileage is better than 
expected
1

mpg is 
decent;
1

the dealer has not been able to fix the problem and acura said they have company cars the act the 
same
1

i test drove the is 350 but i didn't like the riding quality space was too small and 
also

of places where else would you put 
them?
1

the upgraded stereo system is 
awesome
1

traded in my 2001 lexus rx 300 
for
2

and the rdx fit the 
bill
1

in first 11 months car 
was

the sound that comes out of this 
thing

as a single male in his 30s i am the demo 
they
1

i have always bought acuras but 
this
1

wrong this is one high tech 
machine
1

styling very fun to drive and pretty good on gas 
mileage
1
|
~
having had several 
acuras
1
|
~
i was driving a 2005 
mdx
1
|
~
i must confess this is probably the best vehicle honda has ever made right up there with such ground breakers as the nsx and 
s2000
1

owner of all the quality and comfort acura has to offer (which if you let my wife tell the story she already 
knew)
1

~
about going to a 4 
cylinder
1
|
~
this one seems 
quieter
1
|

even with gas 
prices
1

watch out for the awd status display on the dash; you should have your eyes on the road whenever you 
actually

after 3,000 miles i am in love with my mdx 
sport

i traded a 2005 rl which was nice

you get a feel of

1
|
~
get 22-23 mpg at 70-75 mph 
on
1
|
~
i feel as if this vehicle is a bargin even at msrp! 
acura
1
|
~
the rdx performs well 
and
1
|
~
i have owned the car for only 6 weeks and i 
have
1
|
~
wow. i do have to say that acura has created the best in the suv luxury 
class
1
|
~
too. my kids fit 
easily
1
|
~
drive it like a 6 cyl and you'll too complain about 
the
1
|
~
very powerful for its 
size
1
|
~
the interior hugs you the drivers seat is 
very
1
|
~
gas mileage is great too on a 500 mile road trip i averaged 34 
mpg!
1
|
~
until i had more 
miles
1
|
~
best car i ever 
owned
1
|
~
i've had mine for about three weeks now and had an accident on 
the
1
|
~
interior looked too yellow put with upgrade to sport the leather looks much softer and not 
so
1
|
~
car drives nicely although the sportier ride can be a bit 
too
1
|
~
the mdx with just about every luxury suv (ie x5 xc90) on the market 
the
1
|
~
mirror which is now finally included and the open bottom of the steering wheel to rest 
my
1
|
~
cargo space could be a little larger but larger space = larger body = more weight = 
fewer
1

after test driving nearly every car in its class - 
bmw
1

miles
1
|
~
i have a two and a half year old and we added a side 
rail
1
|

took dealer

1
|
~
the interior has the feel of a sports car and the turning radius 
is
1
|
~
the upgraded stereo system is awesome and 
the
1
|
~
this is my first "suv." my previous 
cars
1
|
~
i don't need to 
use
1
|
~
i have been told that this is 
a
1
|
~
on dirt 
and
1
|
~
other than the poor gas 
mileage
1
|
~
if acura corrects this they would have a more 
sought
1
|
~
acuras are rare in germany and i get stares 
all
1
|
~
mine 2 weeks 
ago
1
|
~
anyway this one has much better mpg fun to drive 
great
1
|
~
the design is becoming a little dated and the redesign 
should
1
|
~
superior 
to
1
|
~
this car is a dream to drive and the interior 
design
1
|
~
strip along the bottom 
and
1
|
~
belive me 
this
1
|
~
i haven't tried the sport driving feature yet and probably will not use much 
in
1
|
~
work and family driving less painful and that is exactly 
what
1
|
~
tilt down 
right
1
|
~
i just upgraded my 2005 acura tl for the 2007 acura tl type s 
and
1

is like a science fiction movie at least for someone like me who has never owned a

i have heard people say that the car is

this is the suv of the year when luxury

there is so much

you get a lot for

one of my concerns was moving 
"down"
1

rdx felt more powerful 
than
1

the tech package is with voice control 
is
1

~
i love my new mdx it drives like a true 
luxury
1

i decided 
on
1
|
to
2

~
ride in comfort for most roads and sports car handling 
on
1
|
~
the turbo feels well 
tuned
1
|
~
system also 
does
1
|
~
and the sound system is the 
best
1
|
~
this car never having driven an acura 
before
1
|
~
owned an '05 tl and told the dealer i'd buy a new one 
when
1
|
~
but after driving the new tl type s couldnt resist buying for $10,000 less than bmw! great looking car very fast tech features next 
to
1
|
~
worth a serious look 
and
1
|
~
if you can find one buy it loaded! taupe interior 
is
1
|
~
beside this being my 3rd honda product (2000 accord coupe and then 2005 acura tsx) i was looking 
for
1
|
~
standard luxury features 
include
1
|
~
acura claims that it is a safety feature but it only works 
if
1
|
~
and the gps system but the car rides awesome nice pick-up 
and
1
|
~
there is a good amount of turbo lag making it feel sluggish from a start and the the engine is 
noisy
1
|
~
the more i 
drive
1
|
~
the last two 
problems
1

wipers and auto dimming mirror (which 
didn't

it
1

tl has highest crash test safety ratings highest consumer reports score for its class (entry level 
luxury)
1

takes curves like a

the dvd-nav works great and helped me avoid a traffic jam driving home 
from

the mdx is almost 
as
1

the more i drive it the 
more
1

- handling on par with best sport sedans very quiet 
rides
1
|

i can't believe 
acura's
1

how
1
|
i
1

for an suv (about 21 mpg) and the fun factor is a 10! the ride 
is
1

thought i was going to buy an mdx but after 
driving

package blows my mind and i consider 
myself

i often have to resist the urge to 
just

this suv has much less pick up than my 01 v8 grand cherokee which it replaced (i leave on 'hills' and the car can't stay 60mph on 5th and takes a long time to shift to 
4th
1

the handling is peppy yet 
not
1
|
~
takes some time to get used 
to
1

it handles like it wants to be a sports sedan but it has the luxury and utility to make it one of the 
best

i'm very happy and have had many vehicles before due to leases for work but i bought this one 
and

i also like the fact that

would like to have seen the

i drove the x5 bmw and the mercedes ml class and neither car can hold a

i thought the ride was a bit fairer 
on
1

on a 500 mile 
trip
1

i looked at other 
suvs
1
|

would like to have seen the vehicle have a built in 
phone
1

- only getting around 12mpg city and 18 mpg highway 
at
1

i think its the best value 
in
1

just got it the other day and i am very happy with the 
car
1

the mdx feels 
planted
1

main problem that i didn't notice during my test drive: if you keep the seat erect at a good angle for your posture the head rest 
pushes

took a 600 mile road trip and 
several

i got the black cherry pearl sport

would like to have seen the vehicle have a built in phone

this is my 3rd acura and

the rear view mirror appears to block 1/3 of the vision of

i would have to sum up to say that this vehicle is a very 
big
1

kept it for a couple years and traded it on a nissan

1

the fit and finish on this vehicle is some of the 
bese

in order to get 12-14 mpg a person must be mashing to pedal

is easy to use however expect a learning curve to master all aspects of manual

nothing 
else

has taken

as a father who runs many errands with my son i am pleased with the size of the rdx as it has plenty of interior room and

it handles very

i traded an '03 mdx for this vehicle because i'm single have no

it's the most unique

watch out for the awd status

i traded an '03 mdx for this 
vehicle
1

i love the ack! i turned in a 2004 tl lease and got 
a

first the positive - this is by far the best vehicle i have ever 
owned
1

it is the most fun car to drive 
that

a 265hp v8 a test drive will show this car powers more like a 210 hp

i've had mine almost a year and i love the

first let me just say that i have been a staunch fan of the 
bmw
1
|
~
i live in l.a. and i think i've only seen one or two 
others
1
|
~
i've had the car for a month now and love driving it!! but im getting really bad gas mileage 12.5 mpg

traded in a porsche

i am getting used to the luxury of having a

my land cruiser was too big my fx45 was a lot

love the way the

about trading my 05 for it but i'm glad 
i

just bought the rdx a few weeks ago and i love it!! this is my first suv i test drove others but when i drove this i was 
sold

car)
1

i can't believe i am saying this but i love this vehicle! this coming from a man who wouldn't even consider 
an
1

i've owned my mdx 
since

the reality is that if you are

larger engine gives it a little more power but the interior fit 
and
1

i test drove the bmw x3

with it is minimal but all for now i can observe and suggest that acura improve the 
ride

when compared with these other luxury suvs i would 
have

we love the voice controls for nav climate

i owned and still have a 2005 i didn't 
test
1

power and ride 
are
1

it took about a month to adjust to a bumpier ride but 
the

of the honda engine and drive train i decided to give the acura a 
closer

i'ved owned a couple bmws and we just bought for my wife a 2007

~
this car puts a smile on my face every day on the way to work each morning and tempts me to take the "long 
way"
1
|
~
this may be because the engine needs to break in but with my last acura (mdx) getting poor gas milage i 
am
1
|
~
with 300 hp you will feel 
that
1
|
~
i have to put the gear in the sport mode to minimize the turbo lag when traffic 
is

be lost with a 
more
1

such as is 350 and g35 and none can match the utility and value of the type

we need the awd for the snow and the kids 
stay

with the speed and that's why i didn't realize how fast 
i

i'm amazed 
at

the mdx is a very 
smooth

i'm amazed at how well

i can't believe how much better the 07 type s 
is

work great too 
giving

nice ride but for the bang and the buck the mdx was the clear winner!! 
i
1

i must confess this is probably the best vehicle honda has ever made right up there 
with

i'm amazed at how well the mdx holds it's own with 
the

save yourself 15'000 and get

i wanted the mdx but couldn't get into that one at

small enough to get around the

goes on 
in

a lexus rx 300 and a 330 and having test driven the 2007 lexus gx 470 and the bmw x5 i can say without a 
doubt

the handle on this vehicle is awesome compared to other small suvs thanks 
to

features

those wanting a

looks better with 
side
1

it's our 
first

i am hoping that the car is as reliable as 
other
1

better than the german cars and value wise 
by

vehicle very high tech but 
easy

my wife and i both drive the vehicle so the custom seat mirror radio and phone book settings linked to each 
key

when i first drove the new '07 model

due to its

systems are both very 
well

gas mileage has been around the 19/20mpg with 
mixed

i'm amazed at how well the mdx holds it's own with the little sports car as far as 
feel
1

on the market and nothing 
is
1

in the last month my rdx has been in the shop three times and the last time it didn't even last a week before the emission 
light

to drive down the switch backs 
and
1

i've owned 3 tls and 
this

i have had my 07 mdx for 
about

interior looked too yellow put with upgrade to sport the 
leather

i thought i could get sport and utility in one vehicle and be happy but i 
was

tires in all but 
the

if you have a family with a 
bunch

points that clinched my decision to 
buy
1
|
~
there are so many minor 
details
1
|
~
the interior space 
is
1
|
~
drives like a car! drove it down to disney from nj; enjoyed driving too much that i didn't even 
bother
1
|
~
very powerful for its size and drives like a car with the sh-awd 
making
1
|
~
the cabin is very 
quiet
1
|
~
i was driving it so often that my wife said get your own 
and
1
|
~
honda corp only tell me they can try and "have it fixed" it's been in 7 times 
in
1
|
~
is like mickey mouse 
compared
1
|
~
it drives very well on the open 
road
1
|
~
and you can 
still
1
|
~
that day 
i
1
|
~
we bought the sport package and the leather upgrade was 
worth
1

color bumper is tacky imo for $45k car (i picked 
silver

does not drive quite as well as our saab

you really can't go wrong with the 
rdx
1
|
~
but is much more 
user
1
|
~
on it and i would purchase this car again if i had to do it again! i used to drive a mercedes c240 2005 
but
1
|
~
i concur with all the positive comments seen here and have only one 
big
1
|
~
falters. 
i
1
|
~
i have had the car now for 3 months and 
i
1
|
~
the third row is nice in 
a
1
|
~
a bit of tire noise and a bit of turbo lag are my only small 
gripes
1
|
~
that day i test 
drove
1
|
~
- much better 
than
1
|
~
not too soft 
and
1
|
~
w/3rd row seats 
(x5
1
|
~
i must confess this is probably the best vehicle honda has ever made 
right
1
|
~
love the way the ac/fan 
speed
1

~
in the audio system which actually sounds better in the tsx 
than
1
|
~
as a single male in his 30s i 
am
1
|
~
i realized this vehicle is 
very
1
|
~
xm and traffic is fun but there 
is
1
|
~
i decided to give 
acura
1
|
~
for me was getting used 
to
1
|
~
options 
such
1
|
~
front seats handles very 
well
1

~
of ftd factor room and tech can't be found 
with

if you can

find
1

i've strictly driven lexus for the past few years due to the quality and 
comfort
1
|
~
i did have to replace one of the tires 
because
1
|
~
wipers which were 
on
1
|
~
a bit of tire noise and a 
bit
1
|
~
at first i thought the gearing was weird but in the 
city
1
|
~
dealer has worked 
hard
1
|
~
love this car!! i have had no problem in the first 4000 miles 
and
1
|
~
the choice included bmw x5 mercedes ml350 audi q7 
and
1
|
~
love the engine pulls like some v8s with better 
gas
1
|
~
go for it! tech pack a 
must!
1
|
~
as for the exterior 
of
1
|
~
after driving a large suv for the last four years i am thrilled to be behind the wheel of 
a
1
|
~
this car is like heaven to me! it rides across bumps in 
the
1
|
~
wipers which were on my 
06
1
|
~
kids love the rear ent and we love being able to let the kids listen 
to
1
|
~
so the buying decision was very 
easy
1
|
~
also the new zdx not only has 
the
1
|
~
wipers which were on my 06 mdx 
are
1
|
~
i buy a new car every 
six
1
|
~
but we saw the rdx - good price great quality and it had all of the 
bells
1
|
~
i love this car! i haven't had 
it
1
|
~
and i also have the fuel light problem although mine comes on after 13 gallons are gone 
from
1
|
~
for the price this 
car
1
|
~
is that of a much larger car then the old one but when i get out and look at it it looks much 
smaller
1
|
~
also winter handling and cold weather features were 
other
1
|
~
at times but not needless (like racing to a 
stop
1
|
~
wipers which were on my 06 mdx are 
no
1
|
~
wipers and auto dimming 
mirror
1
|
~
there are known rattles in 
the

i owned hondas for years but 
strayed

mirror which is now finally included and 
the
1

i brought it in a while later and 
the
1

~
feel 
but
1
|
~
my tl has 
proven
1
|
~
very poor fit and finish not 
to
1

driving position and 
actually
1
|
~
i drove the x5 bmw and the mercedes ml class and neither car can hold a candle to my '07 mdx.this vehicle 
is
1

price. this is 
my
1

between the two 
was
1
|

it may not be very sexy to 
look
1
|
~
pack for 
my
1
|
~
lots of reviews about the stiff ride but that is one of the 
things
1
|
~
engine doesn't sound 
as
1
|
~
the rdx drives more 
like
1
|
~
this suv has much less pick up than my 01 v8 grand cherokee which it replaced (i leave on 'hills' and the car can't stay 60mph on 5th 
and
1
|
~
compare the features 
to
1
|
~
as a father who runs many errands with my son i am pleased with 
the
1
|
~
suv on steroids the ride is superb and 
the
1
|

very poor fit and finish not to 
mention
1

and they just don't match the feel of

the interior has 
more

but anyone with ears! it's better than

i've had the car for over a year now and still say "i love my car" when i get

it has no power no soul the

the exterior styling is a real head turner much better than the

i suspect the main knock is that you 
are

but we saw the rdx - good price great quality and it 
had

higher

amazing !! quality of audio is 
also

i had it for about 1 month now and it fits like a glove drives smooth put the pedal to the metal and it will

there is also much to be said about the way acura cares 
for
1

i've owned the vehicle for 6 
weeks
1

~
previous car was a sedan powered by v6 and this little suv 
blows
1

while the car has some zip many 
problems
1

fast nimble great turning radius 
and
1
|
~
you can feel and hear the nice turbo 
engine
1

~
and more at 
12-14k
1

buy the sport 
it's

i hate the steering wheel! it's not the wheel that's so bad 
even
1

finally a luxury suv from 
acura
1

by the quality and features they've added to the 
car

to

gotten 22 mpg ave 
about

i didn't think it was possible to improve on the 
vehicle

and her decision was 
just
1

handling (sh-awd and ads) very safe feeling vehicle very 
good

bought

sitting at idle in heavy traffic you 
can

as for the 
exterior
1

it was a worth wait to get 
mdx

is the equal of the more powerful v6 tl once you get used to the mild turbo 
lag
1

the average mileage at 75 mph with the ac cranked up and the lights and 
radio
1

love the handling

i think it is the best looking car on the road on

i never dreamed that this car would be so much fun! sound system

i haven't had many 
chances
1

there are known rattles in the 2007 tl many coming from the window sills front 
and

is easy to use however expect a learning curve to master all aspects of 
manual

be trained on 
the
1

lexus and bmw i went with acura for their resale

i don't know how others are driving that get less

traded in our

we picked it up this weekend and 
so

the more i drive it 
the

front seats handles

my first tank of gas gave 
me

my use of the car is limited to a 10 round trip commute to the office 5 days a week and about 150 miles of driving over 
the
1

the interior has the 
quality
1

feel
1

i finally 
traded

front seats handles very well 
for

due to 
short
1

problems
1

a
1

its
1

also winter handling and cold weather 
features
1

i love the way the 
car

traded in

a
1

~
front seats handles very well for 
an

love the interior styling and 
dash
1
|
~
we decided to look into the luxury suv segment and narrowed our choices 
to
1
|
~
we took a 6k+ trip this summer and the car turned out 
to
1
|
~
interior fit and finish looks to be gm level the exterior fit of various bits 
is
1
|
~
you cannot beat what comes standard on the tsx for 
the
1
|
~
i have owned two hondas in the past (civic and accord) and wanted another honda but wanted 
more
1
|
~
listen 
to
1
|
~
front seats handles very well for an suv 
with
1
|
~
my 2007 mdx just two days ago and love it! it rides like a luxury suv but with the kick and sporty attitude of a tl or 
tsx
1
|
~
about 4000 
miles
1
|
~
the stereo is 
awesome
1
|
so
1
|
~
yes the car can handle 
but
1
|
~
front seats handles very well for an suv with good power 
and
1

~
vehicle and took a corner to 
fast
1
|

watch out for the awd status display on the dash; you should have your eyes on the 
road
1
|
~
fuel ecomony 
is
1
|
~
gauges are well placed and 
lighted
1
|
~
smooth - real nice! the motor sounds awesome - like a 
turbo
1

i concur with all the positive comments seen here and have only 
one

the mdx drives like a car on twisty roads

gas mileage has been between 18 &

you only need to feather the gas pedal and the turbo 
will

even though tsx is fwd you can enjoy the adequate 
power

when i first got the car i 
found
1

~
i must confess 
this
1
|
~
my third type s and the best one to date as a matter of fact it is 
the
1
|
~
a lexus rx 300 and a 330 and having test driven the 2007 lexus gx 470 and the bmw x5 i can say without a doubt that the 2007 acura mdx - my very first acura - is the best suv i've ever driven and much more fun than driving a car.the sh-awd system alone 
is
1
|
~
but it appears at the 50,000 mile mark you can look for major issues of course that is when the warranty 
expires
1
|

the only thing i would change would 
be
1

mine

or in ?sport 
mode?

you're better off buying a 3rd party nav system and saving a bunch on the 
sticker

the engine is smooth the white lights are super bright the sound system is amazing and it does not feel

added roof rack - solid metal rack and sport running

first thing i want to say is that this suv handles better than a vehicle this large and high

owner of all the quality and comfort acura 
has
1

we never 
felt

thought
1

nice ride but for the bang and the buck the mdx was the clear winner!! i love the way the vehicle moves and the smooth braking action is awesome; not to 
mention
1

perhaps better than my

1

if you can pick up a used one what a great value 
it

my only complain is that the 
voice
1
|
~
this car puts a smile on my 
face
1
|
~
it was a 
wise
1
|
worth
1
|
~
the last acura i owned was a 91 legend coupe it was a 
great
1
|
~
i drove the x5 bmw and the mercedes ml class and neither car can hold a candle to my '07 mdx.this vehicle is as solid as a rock yet moves like a 
light
1
|
~
mileage is ok been getting an overall average of 19 mpg 
this
1
|
~
features are easy to use and the 
voice
1
|
~
i never thought an 
acura
1
|
~
are gas mileage and bumpy ride but those 
are
1
|
~
it was a worth wait 
to
1
|
~
i'ved owned a couple bmws and we just bought 
for
1
|
~
handling (sh-awd and ads) very safe feeling 
vehicle
1
|

would like to have seen the vehicle have a built in phone holder 
and
1

i test drove the bmw

1
|
~
the front seat feels crowded and i have to crouch down in 
my
1
|

area (my home 
of
1
|
~
it was a worth wait to get mdx sh-awd acura advance which has 
best
1
|
~
some thing but there's just so 
much
1
|
~
i just went through 
a

i have a two and a half year old and we added a side rail 
(step)

|
~
an '07 rdx brand 
new
1
|
~
i test drove several suvs (audi q7 rx 350 bmw x5 buick enclave chevy tahoe looked at the lr3 gmc acadia) and nothing came close to the drive and luxury 
that
1
|
~
that needs to be updated because sprint big 
in
1
|
~
i didn't have to test 
drive
1
|
~
you don't have to think twice before 
buying
1
|
~
i've strictly driven lexus 
for
1
|
~
the size of the center console is great and i like that 
it
1
|
~
it gets 22 
to
1
|
~
we looked at the is 350 and the 
g35s
1
|
~
but no suv out there drives this 
well
1
|
~
i had it for about 1 month now and it fits like a glove drives smooth put the pedal to the metal and it 
will
1
|
~
and the awd delivers amazing handling in all 
kinds

corner like on 
rails

once i saw 
this

you don't have to think twice before buying 
mdx

we wanted a change 
and

all the power you need handles well nothing 
to

i have driven this car in lots of snow and 
icy

to let it go because it 
was
1

driving and love every minute of driving it! it's more like

the nav system is not

and come 
on

drove high end

my land cruiser was too big my

kids love the rear ent and we love being able to let the kids listen to

front & back seats are quite roomy & backseat easily folds down flat (2/3 / 1/3) to expand cargo 
space

as

my land cruiser was too big my fx45 was a lot of fun but too 
small

the only thing i really hate 
is

plan to spend a 
night
1

there are a few things 
missing

is the lack 
of

~
plan to spend a night in the garage 
learning
1
|
~
others just have a moving map of sorts this becomes the control center for the 
car
1
|
~
that acura put this car out with such bad gas mileage and there's no way out now 
i
1
|
~
and drove all kinds of cars but 
nothing
1
|
~
there are so many minor details that acura does right to make 
this
1
|
~
the fuel economy is 
simply
1
|
~
plan to spend a night in the garage learning the 
new
1
|
~
the upgrade they offer 
cost
1
|
~
i can't believe how much better the 
07
1
|
~
its a new design so only time will tell 
what
1
|
~
it handles like it wants 
to
1
|
~
we traded in our audi a4 for the tsx and fell in love with the 
comfort
1
|
~
we did the head to head test drives with the bmw x5 porsche 
cayenne
1

~
is not very strong and feels only very slightly 
better
1

plan to spend a night in the garage learning the new 
toys

this vehicle is a big step up from the '02 model: more 
power
1
|
~
just took 
delivery
1
|
~
about 45 miles is on highways 
with
1
|
~
on the tl but they are gone (sort 
of)
1
|
~
do not drive off-road and was 
amazed
1
|
~
if you drive it hard your tank will be empty in no time but that 
is
1
|
~
i use it for business as a home care doctor but 
18
1
|
~
nice ride but for the bang and the buck the mdx 
was
1
|
~
two gripes: first is the poor gas mileage 
(18-19
1
|
~
i thought based on the price of the car why not go 
for
1
|
~
i had an '04 mdx and i 
like
1
|
~
there is room for my wife's luggage the kids and dad's luggage and 
the
1
|
~
the mdx is a nice 
car
1

the features of the tech pkg are 
great

my first tank of gas gave me 16 mpg 
-
1

~
i test drove the rdx with the 
tech
1
|
~
to start off i owned a 2003 
type
1
|
~
every feature 
comes
1
|
~
all types of suvs i narrowed it down to the 
rdx
1
|
~
my 4-runner gets about 20 to 22 mpg 
and
1
|
~
what really sets the '07 apart for us is the handling on 
the
1
|
~
suv. they work great when heading 
out
1
|
~
i have enjoyed it 
from
1

of gas mileage the new mdx 
exceeds

build quality is solid with a lot of 
little

my 07 s-type has a

it is one of the best vehicles i have ever 
owned

i love this color car with the

front & back seats are quite roomy & backseat easily folds down flat (2/3 / 1/3) to 
expand

driving
1

package blows my mind 
and
1

toys
1

this car has plenty of room 
for

3rd row legroom could be better based 
on

i traded in a 2005 mustang for the acura and it suprised 
me
1
|
~
while we enjoy driving 
this
1
|
~
great 18" michelin tires and the superb stereo 
system
1

the styling is 
better

to you that is broken then 
just

ride to its fit and finish - 
this

i must confess this is probably the best vehicle 
honda
1
|
~
averaged 20 
mpg
1
|
~
when cruising at 80 it feels like you're doing 50 because it is so quiet and 
refined
1
|
~
while we enjoy driving this people's heads start turning on 
the
1

gets looks from 
people
1

~
the car actually gets quieter 
over

i thought the ride was 
a
1
|
~
than last 
year
1
|
~
it looks like 
a
1
|
~
good car handles 
nicely
1
|
~
averaged around 20-21 mpg on our trip and 
was
1
|
~
after 10 yrs and 145,000 mi i sold my 528 bmw for a 
tl
1
|
~
looks better with side step 
running
1
|
~
cargo space is ample with the 
rear
1
|
~
took dealer 4 hours to find 
problem
1
|
~
just got it the other day and i am very happy 
with
1
|
~
looks better with side step running boards and 
roof
1
|
~
i chose this 
suv
1
|
~
this is my 4th acura 2 tls an 2 mdxs 
and
1
|
~
added roof rack - solid 
metal
1
|
~
type-s 
was
1
|
best
1
|
~
i must confess this is probably the best vehicle honda has ever made right up there with such ground 
breakers
1
|
~
i usually get 
20-21
1
|
~
so much fun to drive 
it
1
|
~
i test drove the new g35 and well the acura can't quite beat the infiniti as far as straight off the line power however when it comes to the complete package for the 
money
1
|
~
yes it had a luxury ride 
and
1
|
~
drives like a car! drove it down to disney from nj; enjoyed driving too much that i didn't even bother stopping (except for gas) on 
the
1
|
~
power galore for 
a
1
|
~
this is my 7th suv 
and
1
|

but there is a noise coming from the brakes they have tried to fix 4 times and can't get it to go away for more than 
about
1

~
i've owned a new 07 mdx for a month now and have driven it close to 2000 miles in city and 
suburb
1
|
~
i don't know how others are driving 
that
1
|
~
the engine has plenty of pep the interior has plenty of luxury and the 
tech
1

out it is a pleasure to have 
all
1
|
~
stereo and 
very
1
|
~
looking tsx and am happy i 
did
1

~
the 07 mdx is in a class 
by
1
|
~
i don't know how others are driving that get less than 15 mpg but i've been pretty 
much
1
|
~
well very much like a sports car and far 
better
1
|
~
we had a maxima gle but this has way more zip and is 
great
1
|
~
is standard on this car except 
nav

than what 
i
1

where many only offer 
5

enough oomph to pass on

enjoying the 
superb
1

more creature comforts and roughly the same fuel 
economy
1

i really don't get much chance to drive it the way i would like since i am normally stuck in traffic but 
i
1
|
~
go ahead and try 
all
1

~
i shopped 
other
1

best car i've 
had

as a side note i test drove the 07 g35 awd 06 tl (a spec and stock) is350 and bmw

this is the suv of the year when

wow. only concern is the mpg which should get better with

i often have to resist the urge 
to

system
1

it with a bmw x5 (07- 3.0) this was a much lighter vehicle lower 
cost
1

interior and exterior 
are
1

bad points 
-
1

i liked the styling 
and
1

the manual shift mode 
is

deserts bad roads and good - we really put this car through

i chose the rdx because i wanted sport

as i would 
like

the number of features is immense and 
make

i wanted daytime running light side airbags great sound

and the rdx 
fit
1

not as fast 
as

before this 
and
1

bought it a week ago in ottawa canada and drove 
it

we were in the market for a suv with a third row that doesn't feel heavy to drive and we have the

liked

not as smooth as my lexus but plenty of power for the steep roads 
(manual

i really like the feature 
when

the car has a lot of features and the switches and controls seem to be all in

yes the ride is stiff but it's nearly as much fun to drive as my wife's mini cooper which is

in the last month my rdx has been in the shop three times and the last time it didn't even last a week before the emission light went on again and when it goes on it seem to shift down and have less power it has been in the shop this time for a week and they don't know what's wrong with it they are in contact with 
japan

i've strictly driven lexus for the past few years due to the quality

it with a bmw x5

- much better than the old model but 
not

compared to the rx 330 the mdx is 
6
1

yes the ride is

compared to the rx 330 the mdx is 6 inches wider 4 inches longer and 2

1

it does not handle like a race car 
but
1

ample power when needed good fuel economy looks sharp but not 
gaudy
1

it's fun to drive 
again

using

i can't believe i am saying this 
but
1

head lamps light the 
road
1

but given the size and 
weight
1

this car so far has handled 
nicely

all in all it's as near perfect 
as

we are very pleased with our first venture into a luxury 
line

the mdx is almost as nimble 
as

what

unlike the previous model

nothing and i 
mean

system is not 
better
1

gps the mdx 
uses
1

be very careful of the rdx: the 
front

if you want 30 mpg then be willing to settle for less than 286 hp and slow down your 
driving

2750

no pep when you step on

down

maybe a $90+k mercedes has it beat but i

be very careful of the rdx: the front end has a problem that will need to

first thing 
i
1

we'll just spend the money we just saved

it just seems so much more refined interior comfort is

and i also thanked myself for having the wisdom to purchase one of

as one who had been driving 6 & 8 cyl

this vehicle over

1

the third row is fine for kids

my husband is always 
trying

i find this vehicle 
to

it rides like (even better than) my 
lexus
1

we wanted an awd sedan after a string 
of

much
1

thought about upgrade to

my wife loves this vehicle 
because
1
|
~
10,000 miles into 
my
1
|
~
i've owned over a 
dozen
1
|
~
it just seems so much more refined interior comfort is great and the ride is less 
harsh
1
|
~
this vehicle has been a big 
letdown
1
|
~
of front wheel 
drive
1
|
~
2007 mdx may be 
best
1
|
~
i've owned over a dozen hondas 
and
1
|
~
i hope to keep 
the
1
|
~
the cx-7 the rdx is hands down 
the
1

because of its 
handsome
1

i've owned over a dozen hondas and 
acuras
1

i loved the awd 
of
1

also i hear that even more 
power
1

if you can find one buy 
it
1

~
i must confess this is probably the best 
vehicle
1
|
~
test drive it for 
a
1

~
i thought the ride was a bit fairer on the 
bmw
1
|
~
we were in the market for a 
suv
1
|
~
i must confess this is probably the best vehicle honda has ever 
made
1
|
~
and not to mention the tech 
features
1
|
~
about the mpg but if one does not step on 
the
1
|
~
i must confess this is probably the best vehicle honda has ever made right 
up

the third row is nice in a 
pinch

i cannot wait for a long 
trip
1

yes 3rd row is for kids and 
small
1
|
~
the mdx feels planted on the road with minimal 
roll
1
|
~
honda has simply built an suv version of the acura 
rl
1
|
~
may be better in one category 
or
1
|
~
no ac vents for the poor people in 
the
1
|
~
this may be because the engine needs to break in but with 
my
1

after owning this 
vehicle
1

on a return trip 
to

i should know since 
i

i have had the rdx for two months and think it is a blast 
to

i love the nav system 
and

the sh-awd system is terrific as you feel it pull you around sharp turns as 
you

never had an suv with the power 
and

i had been 
driving

this is the best of 
its

that acura put this car out with such bad gas mileage and there's no way

my kids love the heated rear seats 
and
1

acura did a good 
job
1

and i also have the fuel light problem although mine comes on after 13 gallons are

this could cut into 0-60 times

with the speed and that's why i didn't realize how fast i was

i was leery about the fwd with 289 horses mated to it but torque steer is minimal (and kind of fun) and it 
does
1
|
~
cargo space could be a little 
larger
1

the mdx is much better in the snow than 3 truck base suvs i have 
owned

no defects or 
repairs

so

not as smooth as my lexus 
but

this is my 7th suv and 
my

falters. i really enjoy 
driving
1

you just need to drive it for yourself to find out if it is a fit for 
you
1

so no problem pulling up to upscale places! i didn't want to give 
up

the second week i had ignition problem which

even though this car

it fits both of our kids (with car 
seats)

of acura 
&

can
1

but this vehicle gets pretty 
decent

ride
1

when stomping on it it 
can
1

although for some reason it 
keeps
1

has taken a 
bit

but this vehicle gets pretty decent 
milage
1

the brakes seem a bit weak but again

i picked up the car in feb and after 1 month of driving 
i
1
|

the interior has the feel of a sports car and the turning radius is 
awesome
1

~
for the power this engine pumps out and 
the
1

~
is great for a two 
ton
1
|
~
pushes you off 
the
1
|
~
also the new zdx not only has the ugly front but it also has 
an
1

but
1

back support in the driver's 
seat

i haven't had it long 
enough
1

i enjoy

the rearview camera takes a couple of seconds to come on but gives

better!

gets looks 
from

also need to exchange low profile tires for winter tires (in new

the mdx actually drives like a sports sedan and not an

this is one of the first cars i have owned that doesn't

the reality is that if you are going to get poor gas mileage you might

have put over 2000 miles on it in less than

beside this being my 3rd honda product (2000 accord

this suv has much less pick up than

we never thought we would find a better ride 
than

and as 
a
1

when i first got the car i found 
myself
1

rattles are coming from 
the
1

of voice commands to 
learn
1

about poor fuel economy and a harsh ride should 
be

tip for those who do not like the tl-s wheels: i asked the dealer if he could trade out the tl-s wheels for the 
regular

my wife and i both drive the

so it's 
not

so it's not a bad balance as 
is

in this class and the tl type-s is by far the nicest looking nicest driving and the
